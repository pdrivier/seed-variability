0,geco,1-1,The intense  interest  aroused  in  the  public  by  what  was  known  at  the  time  as  'The  Styles  Case'  has  now  somewhat  subsided. 
1,geco,1-2,"Nevertheless,  in  view  of  the  world-wide  notoriety  which  attended  it,  I  have  been  asked,  both  by  my  friend  Poirot  and  the  family  themselves,  to  write  an  account  of  the  whole  story. "
2,geco,1-3,"This,  we  trust,  will  effectually  silence  the  sensational  rumours  which  still  persist. "
3,geco,1-4,I  will  therefore  briefly  set  down  the  circumstances  which  led  to  my  being  connected  with  the  affair. 
4,geco,1-5,"I  had  been  invalided  home  from  the  Front;  and,  after  spending  some  months  in  a  rather  depressing  Convalescent  Home,  was  given  a  month's  sick  leave. "
5,geco,1-6,"Having  no  near  relations  or  friends,  I  was  trying  to  make  up  my  mind  what  to  do,  when  I  ran  across  John  Cavendish. "
6,geco,1-7,I  had  seen  very  little  of  him  for  some  years. 
7,geco,1-8,"Indeed,  I  had  never  known  him  particularly  well. "
8,geco,1-9,"He  was  a  good  fifteen  years  my  senior,  for  one  thing,  though  he  hardly  looked  his  forty-five  years. "
9,geco,1-10,"As  a  boy,  though,  I  had  often  stayed  at  Styles,  his  mother's  place  in  Essex. "
10,geco,1-11,"We  had  a  good  yarn  about  old  times,  and  it  ended  in  his  inviting  me  down  to  Styles  to  spend  my  leave  there. "
11,geco,1-12,"The  mater  will  be  delighted  to  see  you  again...after  all  those  years,  he  added. "
12,geco,1-13,Your  mother  keeps  well?  I  asked. 
13,geco,1-14,"Oh,  yes. "
14,geco,1-15,I  suppose  you  know  that  she  has  married  again? 
15,geco,1-16,I  am  afraid  I  showed  my  surprise  rather  plainly. 
16,geco,1-17,"Mr.s.  Cavendish,  who  had  married  John's  father  when  he  was  a  widower  with  two  sons,  had  been  a  handsome  woman  of  middle-age  as  I  remembered  her. "
17,geco,1-18,She  certainly  could  not  be  a  day  less  than  seventy  now. 
18,geco,1-19,"I  recalled  her  as  an  energetic,  autocratic  personality,  somewhat  inclined  to  charitable  and  social  notoriety,  with  a  fondness  for  opening  bazaars  and  playing  the  Lady  Bountiful. "
19,geco,1-20,"She  was  a  most  generous  woman,  and  possessed  a  considerable  fortune  of  her  own. "
20,geco,1-21,"Their  country-place,  Styles  Court,  had  been  purchased  by  mr  Cavendish  early  in  their  married  life. "
21,geco,1-22,"He  had  been  completely  under  his  wife's  ascendancy,  so  much  so  that,  on  dying,  he  left  the  place  to  her  for  her  lifetime,  as  well  as  the  larger  part  of  his  income;  an  arrangement  that  was  distinctly  unfair  to  his  two  sons. "
22,geco,1-23,"Their  step-mother,  however,  had  always  been  most  generous  to  them;  indeed,  they  were  so  young  at  the  time  of  their  father's  remarriage  that  they  always  thought  of  her  as  their  own  mother. "
23,geco,1-24,"Lawrence,  the  younger,  had  been  a  delicate  youth. "
24,geco,1-25,"He  had  qualified  as  a  doctor  but  early  relinquished  the  profession  of  medicine,  and  lived  at  home  while  pursuing  literary  ambitions;  though  his  verses  never  had  any  marked  success. "
25,geco,1-26,"John  practiced  for  some  time  as  a  barrister,  but  had  finally  settled  down  to  the  more  congenial  life  of  a  country  squire. "
26,geco,1-27,"He  had  married  two  years  ago,  and  had  taken  his  wife  to  live  at  Styles,  though  I  entertained  a  shrewd  suspicion  that  he  would  have  preferred  his  mother  to  increase  his  allowance,  which  would  have  enabled  him  to  have  a  home  of  his  own. "
27,geco,1-28,"Mr.s.  Cavendish,  however,  was  a  lady  who  liked  to  make  her  own  plans,  and  expected  other  people  to  fall  in  with  them,  and  in  this  case  she  certainly  had  the  whip  hand,  namely:  the  purse  strings. "
28,geco,1-29,John  noticed  my  surprise  at  the  news  of  his  mother's  remarriage  and  smiled  rather  ruefully. 
29,geco,1-30,Rotten  little  bounder  too!  he  said  savagely. 
30,geco,1-31,"I  can  tell  you,  Hastings,  it's  making  life  jolly  difficult  for  us. "
31,geco,1-32,As  for  Evie...you  remember  Evie? 
32,geco,1-33,No. 
33,geco,1-34,"Oh,  I  suppose  she  was  after  your  time. "
34,geco,1-35,"She's  the  mater's  factotum,  companion,  Jack  of  all  trades! "
35,geco,1-36,A  great  sport...old  Evie! 
36,geco,1-37,"Not  precisely  young  and  beautiful,  but  as  game  as  they  make  them. "
37,geco,1-38,You  were  going  to  say......? 
38,geco,1-39,"Oh,  this  fellow! "
39,geco,1-40,"He  turned  up  from  nowhere,  on  the  pretext  of  being  a  second  cousin  or  something  of  Evie's,  though  she  didn't  seem  particularly  keen  to  acknowledge  the  relationship. "
40,geco,1-41,"The  fellow  is  an  absolute  outsider,  anyone  can  see  that. "
41,geco,1-42,"He's  got  a  great  black  beard,  and  wears  patent  leather  boots  in  all  weathers! "
42,geco,1-43,"But  the  mater  cottoned  to  him  at  once,  took  him  on  as  secretary...you  know  how  she's  always  running  a  hundred  societies? "
43,geco,1-44,I  nodded. 
44,geco,1-45,"Well,  of  course  the  war  has  turned  the  hundreds  into  thousands. "
45,geco,1-46,No  doubt  the  fellow  was  very  useful  to  her. 
46,geco,1-47,"But  you  could  have  knocked  us  all  down  with  a  feather  when,  three  months  ago,  she  suddenly  announced  that  she  and  Alfred  were  engaged! "
47,geco,1-48,The  fellow  must  be  at  least  twenty  years  younger  than  she  is! 
48,geco,1-49,"It's  simply  bare-faced  fortune  hunting;  but  there  you  are...she  is  her  own  mistress,  and  she's  married  him. "
49,geco,1-50,It  must  be  a  difficult  situation  for  you  all. 
50,geco,1-51,Difficult! 
51,geco,1-52,It's  damnable! 
52,geco,1-53,"Thus  it  came  about  that,  three  days  later,  I  descended  from  the  train  at  Styles  St. "
53,geco,1-54,"Mary,  an  absurd  little  station,  with  no  apparent  reason  for  existence,  perched  up  in  the  midst  of  green  fields  and  country  lanes. "
54,geco,1-55,"John  Cavendish  was  waiting  on  the  platform,  and  piloted  me  out  to  the  car. "
55,geco,1-56,"Got  a  drop  or  two  of  petrol  still,  you  see,  he  remarked. "
56,geco,1-57,Mainly  owing  to  the  mater's  activities. 
57,geco,1-58,The  village  of  Styles  St. 
58,geco,1-59,"Mary  was  situated  about  two  miles  from  the  little  station,  and  Styles  Court  lay  a  mile  the  other  side  of  it. "
59,geco,1-60,"It  was  a  still,  warm  day  in  early  July. "
60,geco,1-61,"As  one  looked  out  over  the  flat  Essex  country,  lying  so  green  and  peaceful  under  the  afternoon  sun,  it  seemed  almost  impossible  to  believe  that,  not  so  very  far  away,  a  great  war  was  running  its  appointed  course. "
61,geco,1-62,I  felt  I  had  suddenly  strayed  into  another  world. 
62,geco,1-63,"As  we  turned  in  at  the  lodge  gates,  John  said:  I'm  afraid  you'll  find  it  very  quiet  down  here,  Hastings. "
63,geco,1-64,"My  dear  fellow,  that's  just  what  I  want. "
64,geco,1-65,"Oh,  it's  pleasant  enough  if  you  want  to  lead  the  idle  life. "
65,geco,1-66,"I  drill  with  the  volunteers  twice  a  week,  and  lend  a  hand  at  the  farms. "
66,geco,1-67,My  wife  works  regularly  'on  the  land'. 
67,geco,1-68,"She  is  up  at  five  every  morning  to  milk,  and  keeps  at  it  steadily  until  lunchtime. "
68,geco,1-69,It's  a  jolly  good  life  taking  it  all  round...if  it  weren't  for  that  fellow  Alfred  Inglethorp! 
69,geco,1-70,"He  checked  the  car  suddenly,  and  glanced  at  his  watch. "
70,geco,1-71,I  wonder  if  we've  time  to  pick  up  Cynthia. 
71,geco,1-72,"No,  she'll  have  started  from  the  hospital  by  now. "
72,geco,1-73,Cynthia! 
73,geco,1-74,That's  not  your  wife? 
74,geco,1-75,"No,  Cynthia  is  a  protegee  of  my  mother's,  the  daughter  of  an  old  schoolfellow  of  hers,  who  married  a  rascally  solicitor. "
75,geco,1-76,"He  came  a  cropper,  and  the  girl  was  left  an  orphan  and  penniless. "
76,geco,1-77,"My  mother  came  to  the  rescue,  and  Cynthia  has  been  with  us  nearly  two  years  now. "
77,geco,1-78,"She  works  in  the  Red  Cross  Hospital  at  Tadminster,  seven  miles  away. "
78,geco,1-79,"As  he  spoke  the  last  words,  we  drew  up  in  front  of  the  fine  old  house. "
79,geco,1-80,"A  lady  in  a  stout  tweed  skirt,  who  was  bending  over  a  flower  bed,  straightened  herself  at  our  approach. "
80,geco,1-81,"Hullo,  Evie,  here's  our  wounded  hero! "
81,geco,1-82,mr  Hastings...Miss  Howard. 
82,geco,1-83,"Miss  Howard  shook  hands  with  a  hearty,  almost  painful,  grip. "
83,geco,1-84,I  had  an  impression  of  very  blue  eyes  in  a  sunburnt  face. 
84,geco,1-85,"She  was  a  pleasant-looking  woman  of  about  forty,  with  a  deep  voice,  almost  manly  in  its  stentorian  tones,  and  had  a  large  sensible  square  body,  with  feet  to  match...these  last  encased  in  good  thick  boots. "
85,geco,1-86,"Her  conversation,  I  soon  found,  was  couched  in  the  telegraphic  style. "
86,geco,1-87,Weeds  grow  like  house  afire. 
87,geco,1-88,Can't  keep  even  with  'em. 
88,geco,1-89,Shall  press  you  in. 
89,geco,1-90,Better  be  careful. 
90,geco,1-91,"I'm  sure  I  shall  be  only  too  delighted  to  make  myself  useful,  I  responded. "
91,geco,1-92,Don't  say  it. 
92,geco,1-93,Never  does. 
93,geco,1-94,Wish  you  hadn't  later. 
94,geco,1-95,"You're  a  cynic,  Evie,  said  John,  laughing. "
95,geco,1-96,Where's  tea  today...inside  or  out? 
96,geco,1-97,Out. 
97,geco,1-98,Too  fine  a  day  to  be  cooped  up  in  the  house. 
98,geco,1-99,"Come  on  then,  you've  done  enough  gardening  for  today. "
99,geco,1-100,"'The  labourer  is  worthy  of  his  hire',  you  know. "
100,geco,1-101,Come  and  be  refreshed. 
101,geco,1-102,"Well,  said  Miss  Howard,  drawing  off  her  gardening  gloves,  I'm  inclined  to  agree  with  you. "
102,geco,1-103,She  led  the  way  round  the  house  to  where  tea  was  spread  under  the  shade  of  a  large  sycamore. 
103,geco,1-104,"A  figure  rose  from  one  of  the  basket  chairs,  and  came  a  few  steps  to  meet  us. "
104,geco,1-105,"My  wife,  Hastings,  said  John. "
105,geco,1-106,I  shall  never  forget  my  first  sight  of  Mary  Cavendish. 
106,geco,1-107,"Her  tall,  slender  form,  outlined  against  the  bright  light;  the  vivid  sense  of  slumbering  fire  that  seemed  to  find  expression  only  in  those  wonderful  tawny  eyes  of  hers,  remarkable  eyes,  different  from  any  other  woman's  that  I  have  ever  known;  the  intense  power  of  stillness  she  possessed,  which  nevertheless  conveyed  the  impression  of  a  wild  untamed  spirit  in  an  exquisitely  civilised  body...all  these  things  are  burnt  into  my  memory. "
107,geco,1-108,I  shall  never  forget  them. 
108,geco,1-109,"She  greeted  me  with  a  few  words  of  pleasant  welcome  in  a  low  clear  voice,  and  I  sank  into  a  basket  chair  feeling  distinctly  glad  that  I  had  accepted  John's  invitation. "
109,geco,1-110,"Mr.s.  Cavendish  gave  me  some  tea,  and  her  few  quiet  remarks  heightened  my  first  impression  of  her  as  a  thoroughly  fascinating  woman. "
110,geco,1-111,"An  appreciative  listener  is  always  stimulating,  and  I  described,  in  a  humorous  manner,  certain  incidents  of  my  Convalescent  Home,  in  a  way  which,  I  flatter  myself,  greatly  amused  my  hostess. "
111,geco,1-112,"John,  of  course,  good  fellow  though  he  is,  could  hardly  be  called  a  brilliant  conversationalist. "
112,geco,1-113,"At  that  moment  a  well  remembered  voice  floated  through  the  open  French  window  near  at  hand:  Then  you'll  write  to  the  Princess  after  tea,  Alfred? "
113,geco,1-114,"I'll  write  to  Lady  Tadminster  for  the  second  day,  myself. "
114,geco,1-115,Or  shall  we  wait  until  we  hear  from  the  Princess? 
115,geco,1-116,"In  case  of  a  refusal,  Lady  Tadminster  might  open  it  the  first  day,  and  Mr.s.  Crosbie  the  second. "
116,geco,1-117,Then  there's  the  Duchess...about  the  school  fete. 
117,geco,1-118,"There  was  the  murmur  of  a  man's  voice,  and  then  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  rose  in  reply:  Yes,  certainly. "
118,geco,1-119,After  tea  will  do  quite  well. 
119,geco,1-120,"You  are  so  thoughtful,  Alfred  dear. "
120,geco,1-121,"The  French  window  swung  open  a  little  wider,  and  a  handsome  white-haired  old  lady,  with  a  somewhat  masterful  cast  of  features,  stepped  out  of  it  on  to  the  lawn. "
121,geco,1-122,"A  man  followed  her,  a  suggestion  of  deference  in  his  manner. "
122,geco,1-123,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  greeted  me  with  effusion. 
123,geco,1-124,"Why,  if  it  isn't  too  delightful  to  see  you  again,  mr  Hastings,  after  all  these  years. "
124,geco,1-125,"Alfred,  darling,  mr  Hastings...my  husband. "
125,geco,1-126,I  looked  with  some  curiosity  at  'Alfred  darling'. 
126,geco,1-127,He  certainly  struck  a  rather  alien  note. 
127,geco,1-128,I  did  not  wonder  at  John  objecting  to  his  beard. 
128,geco,1-129,It  was  one  of  the  longest  and  blackest  I  have  ever  seen. 
129,geco,1-130,"He  wore  gold-rimmed  pince-nez,  and  had  a  curious  impassivity  of  feature. "
130,geco,1-131,"It  struck  me  that  he  might  look  natural  on  a  stage,  but  was  strangely  out  of  place  in  real  life. "
131,geco,1-132,His  voice  was  rather  deep  and  unctuous. 
132,geco,1-133,"He  placed  a  wooden  hand  in  mine  and  said:  This  is  a  pleasure,  mr  Hastings. "
133,geco,1-134,"Then,  turning  to  his  wife:  Emily  dearest,  I  think  that  cushion  is  a  little  damp. "
134,geco,1-135,"She  beamed  fondly  on  him,  as  he  substituted  another  with  every  demonstration  of  the  tenderest  care. "
135,geco,1-136,Strange  infatuation  of  an  otherwise  sensible  woman! 
136,geco,1-137,"With  the  presence  of  mr  Inglethorp,  a  sense  of  constraint  and  veiled  hostility  seemed  to  settle  down  upon  the  company. "
137,geco,1-138,"Miss  Howard,  in  particular,  took  no  pains  to  conceal  her  feelings. "
138,geco,1-139,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp,  however,  seemed  to  notice  nothing  unusual. "
139,geco,1-140,"Her  volubility,  which  I  remembered  of  old,  had  lost  nothing  in  the  intervening  years,  and  she  poured  out  a  steady  flood  of  conversation,  mainly  on  the  subject  of  the  forthcoming  bazaar  which  she  was  organizing  and  which  was  to  take  place  shortly. "
140,geco,1-141,Occasionally  she  referred  to  her  husband  over  a  question  of  days  or  dates. 
141,geco,1-142,His  watchful  and  attentive  manner  never  varied. 
142,geco,1-143,"From  the  very  first  I  took  a  firm  and  rooted  dislike  to  him,  and  I  flatter  myself  that  my  first  judgments  are  usually  fairly  shrewd. "
143,geco,1-144,"Presently  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  turned  to  give  some  instructions  about  letters  to  Evelyn  Howard,  and  her  husband  addressed  me  in  his  painstaking  voice:  Is  soldiering  your  regular  profession,  mr  Hastings? "
144,geco,1-145,"No,  before  the  war  I  was  in  Lloyd's. "
145,geco,1-146,And  you  will  return  there  after  it  is  over? 
146,geco,1-147,Perhaps. 
147,geco,1-148,Either  that  or  a  fresh  start  altogether. 
148,geco,1-149,Mary  Cavendish  leant  forward. 
149,geco,1-150,"What  would  you  really  choose  as  a  profession,  if  you  could  just  consult  your  inclination? "
150,geco,1-151,"Well,  that  depends. "
151,geco,1-152,No  secret  hobby?  she  asked. 
152,geco,1-153,Tell  me...you're  drawn  to  something? 
153,geco,1-154,Every  one  is...usually  something  absurd. 
154,geco,1-155,You'll  laugh  at  me. 
155,geco,1-156,She  smiled. 
156,geco,1-157,Perhaps. 
157,geco,1-158,"Well,  I've  always  had  a  secret  hankering  to  be  a  detective! "
158,geco,1-159,The  real  thing...Scotland  Yard? 
159,geco,1-160,Or  Sherlock  Holmes? 
160,geco,1-161,"Oh,  Sherlock  Holmes  by  all  means. "
161,geco,1-162,"But  really,  seriously,  I  am  awfully  drawn  to  it. "
162,geco,1-163,"I  came  across  a  man  in  Belgium  once,  a  very  famous  detective,  and  he  quite  inflamed  me. "
163,geco,1-164,He  was  a  marvellous  little  fellow. 
164,geco,1-165,He  used  to  say  that  all  good  detective  work  was  a  mere  matter  of  method. 
165,geco,1-166,My  system  is  based  on  his...though  of  course  I  have  progressed  rather  further. 
166,geco,1-167,"He  was  a  funny  little  man,  a  great  dandy,  but  wonderfully  clever. "
167,geco,1-168,"Like  a  good  detective  story  myself,  remarked  Miss  Howard. "
168,geco,1-169,"Lots  of  nonsense  written,  though. "
169,geco,1-170,Criminal  discovered  in  last  chapter. 
170,geco,1-171,Every  one  dumbfounded. 
171,geco,1-172,Real  crime...you'd  know  at  once. 
172,geco,1-173,"There  have  been  a  great  number  of  undiscovered  crimes,  I  argued. "
173,geco,1-174,"Don't  mean  the  police,  but  the  people  that  are  right  in  it. "
174,geco,1-175,The  family. 
175,geco,1-176,You  couldn't  really  hoodwink  them. 
176,geco,1-177,They'd  know. 
177,geco,1-178,"Then,  I  said,  much  amused,  you  think  that  if  you  were  mixed  up  in  a  crime,  say  a  murder,  you'd  be  able  to  spot  the  murderer  right  off? "
178,geco,1-179,Of  course  I  should. 
179,geco,1-180,Mightn't  be  able  to  prove  it  to  a  pack  of  lawyers. 
180,geco,1-181,But  I'm  certain  I'd  know. 
181,geco,1-182,I'd  feel  it  in  my  fingertips  if  he  came  near  me. 
182,geco,1-183,"It  might  be  a  'she,'  I  suggested. "
183,geco,1-184,Might. 
184,geco,1-185,But  murder's  a  violent  crime. 
185,geco,1-186,Associate  it  more  with  a  man. 
186,geco,1-187,Not  in  a  case  of  poisoning. 
187,geco,1-188,Mr.s.  Cavendish's  clear  voice  startled  me. 
188,geco,1-189,"Dr  Bauerstein  was  saying  yesterday  that,  owing  to  the  general  ignorance  of  the  more  uncommon  poisons  among  the  medical  profession,  there  were  probably  countless  cases  of  poisoning  quite  unsuspected. "
189,geco,1-190,"Why,  Mary,  what  a  gruesome  conversation!  cried  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. "
190,geco,1-191,It  makes  me  feel  as  if  a  goose  were  walking  over  my  grave. 
191,geco,1-192,"Oh,  there's  Cynthia! "
192,geco,1-193,A  young  girl  in  V. 
193,geco,1-194,A. 
194,geco,1-195,D. 
195,geco,1-196,uniform  ran  lightly  across  the  lawn. 
196,geco,1-197,"Why,  Cynthia,  you  are  late  today. "
197,geco,1-198,This  is  mr  Hastings...Miss  Murdoch. 
198,geco,1-199,"Cynthia  Murdoch  was  a  fresh-looking  young  creature,  full  of  life  and  vigour. "
199,geco,1-200,She  tossed  off  her  little  V. 
200,geco,1-201,A. 
201,geco,1-202,D. 
202,geco,1-203,"cap,  and  I  admired  the  great  loose  waves  of  her  auburn  hair,  and  the  smallness  and  whiteness  of  the  hand  she  held  out  to  claim  her  tea. "
203,geco,1-204,With  dark  eyes  and  eyelashes  she  would  have  been  a  beauty. 
204,geco,1-205,"She  flung  herself  down  on  the  ground  beside  John,  and  as  I  handed  her  a  plate  of  sandwiches  she  smiled  up  at  me. "
205,geco,1-206,"Sit  down  here  on  the  grass,  do. "
206,geco,1-207,It's  ever  so  much  nicer. 
207,geco,1-208,I  dropped  down  obediently. 
208,geco,1-209,"You  work  at  Tadminster,  don't  you,  Miss  Murdoch? "
209,geco,1-210,She  nodded. 
210,geco,1-211,For  my  sins. 
211,geco,1-212,"Do  they  bully  you,  then?  I  asked,  smiling. "
212,geco,1-213,I  should  like  to  see  them!  cried  Cynthia  with  dignity. 
213,geco,1-214,"I  have  got  a  cousin  who  is  nursing,  I  remarked. "
214,geco,1-215,And  she  is  terrified  of  'Sisters'. 
215,geco,1-216,I  don't  wonder. 
216,geco,1-217,"Sisters  are,  you  know,  mr  Hastings. "
217,geco,1-218,They  simply  are! 
218,geco,1-219,You've  no  idea! 
219,geco,1-220,"But  I'm  not  a  nurse,  thank  heaven,  I  work  in  the  dispensary. "
220,geco,1-221,"How  many  people  do  you  poison?  I  asked,  smiling. "
221,geco,1-222,Cynthia  smiled  too. 
222,geco,1-223,"Oh,  hundreds!  she  said. "
223,geco,1-224,"Cynthia,  called  Mr.s.  Inglethorp,  do  you  think  you  could  write  a  few  notes  for  me? "
224,geco,1-225,"Certainly,  Aunt  Emily. "
225,geco,1-226,"She  jumped  up  promptly,  and  something  in  her  manner  reminded  me  that  her  position  was  a  dependent  one,  and  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp,  kind  as  she  might  be  in  the  main,  did  not  allow  her  to  forget  it. "
226,geco,1-227,My  hostess  turned  to  me. 
227,geco,1-228,John  will  show  you  your  room. 
228,geco,1-229,Supper  is  at  half-past  seven. 
229,geco,1-230,We  have  given  up  late  dinner  for  some  time  now. 
230,geco,1-231,"Lady  Tadminster,  our  Member's  wife...she  was  the  late  Lord  Abbotsbury's  daughter...does  the  same. "
231,geco,1-232,She  agrees  with  me  that  one  must  set  an  example  of  economy. 
232,geco,1-233,"We  are  quite  a  war  household;  nothing  is  wasted  here...every  scrap  of  waste  paper,  even,  is  saved  and  sent  away  in  sacks. "
233,geco,1-234,"I  expressed  my  appreciation,  and  John  took  me  into  the  house  and  up  the  broad  staircase,  which  forked  right  and  left  half-way  to  different  wings  of  the  building. "
234,geco,1-235,"My  room  was  in  the  left  wing,  and  looked  out  over  the  park. "
235,geco,1-236,"John  left  me,  and  a  few  minutes  later  I  saw  him  from  my  window  walking  slowly  across  the  grass  arm  in  arm  with  Cynthia  Murdoch. "
236,geco,1-237,"I  heard  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  call  Cynthia  impatiently,  and  the  girl  started  and  ran  back  to  the  house. "
237,geco,1-238,"At  the  same  moment,  a  man  stepped  out  from  the  shadow  of  a  tree  and  walked  slowly  in  the  same  direction. "
238,geco,1-239,"He  looked  about  forty,  very  dark  with  a  melancholy  clean-shaven  face. "
239,geco,1-240,Some  violent  emotion  seemed  to  be  mastering  him. 
240,geco,1-241,"He  looked  up  at  my  window  as  he  passed,  and  I  recognized  him,  though  he  had  changed  much  in  the  fifteen  years  that  had  elapsed  since  we  last  met. "
241,geco,1-242,"It  was  John's  younger  brother,  Lawrence  Cavendish. "
242,geco,1-243,I  wondered  what  it  was  that  had  brought  that  singular  expression  to  his  face. 
243,geco,1-244,"Then  I  dismissed  him  from  my  mind,  and  returned  to  the  contemplation  of  my  own  affairs. "
244,geco,1-245,"The  evening  passed  pleasantly  enough;  and  I  dreamed  that  night  of  that  enigmatical  woman,  Mary  Cavendish. "
245,geco,1-246,"The  next  morning  dawned  bright  and  sunny,  and  I  was  full  of  the  anticipation  of  a  delightful  visit. "
246,geco,1-247,"I  did  not  see  Mr.s.  Cavendish  until  lunch-time,  when  she  volunteered  to  take  me  for  a  walk,  and  we  spent  a  charming  afternoon  roaming  in  the  woods,  returning  to  the  house  about  five. "
247,geco,1-248,"As  we  entered  the  large  hall,  John  beckoned  us  both  into  the  smoking-room. "
248,geco,1-249,I  saw  at  once  by  his  face  that  something  disturbing  had  occurred. 
249,geco,1-250,"We  followed  him  in,  and  he  shut  the  door  after  us. "
250,geco,1-251,"Look  here,  Mary,  there's  the  deuce  of  a  mess. "
251,geco,1-252,"Evie's  had  a  row  with  Alfred  Inglethorp,  and  she's  off. "
252,geco,1-253,Evie? 
253,geco,1-254,Off? 
254,geco,1-255,John  nodded  gloomily. 
255,geco,1-256,"Yes;  you  see  she  went  to  the  mater,  and...Oh,  here's  Evie  herself. "
256,geco,1-257,Miss  Howard  entered. 
257,geco,1-258,"Her  lips  were  set  grimly  together,  and  she  carried  a  small  suit-case. "
258,geco,1-259,"She  looked  excited  and  determined,  and  slightly  on  the  defensive. "
259,geco,1-260,"At  any  rate,  she  burst  out,  I've  spoken  my  mind! "
260,geco,1-261,"My  dear  Evelyn,  cried  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  this  can't  be  true! "
261,geco,1-262,Miss  Howard  nodded  grimly. 
262,geco,1-263,True  enough! 
263,geco,1-264,Afraid  I  said  some  things  to  Emily  she  won't  forget  or  forgive  in  a  hurry. 
264,geco,1-265,Don't  mind  if  they've  only  sunk  in  a  bit. 
265,geco,1-266,"Probably  water  off  a  duck's  back,  though. "
266,geco,1-267,"I  said  right  out:  'You're  an  old  woman,  Emily,  and  there's  no  fool  like  an  old  fool. "
267,geco,1-268,"The  man's  twenty  years  younger  than  you,  and  don't  you  fool  yourself  as  to  what  he  married  you  for. "
268,geco,1-269,Money! 
269,geco,1-270,"Well,  don't  let  him  have  too  much  of  it. "
270,geco,1-271,Farmer  Raikes  has  got  a  very  pretty  young  wife. 
271,geco,1-272,Just  ask  your  Alfred  how  much  time  he  spends  over  there.' 
272,geco,1-273,She  was  very  angry. 
273,geco,1-274,Natural! 
274,geco,1-275,"I  went  on,  'I'm  going  to  warn  you,  whether  you  like  it  or  not. "
275,geco,1-276,That  man  would  as  soon  murder  you  in  your  bed  as  look  at  you. 
276,geco,1-277,He's  a  bad  lot. 
277,geco,1-278,"You  can  say  what  you  like  to  me,  but  remember  what  I've  told  you. "
278,geco,1-279,He's  a  bad  lot!' 
279,geco,1-280,What  did  she  say? 
280,geco,1-281,Miss  Howard  made  an  extremely  expressive  grimace. 
281,geco,1-282,Darling  Alfred'...'dearest  Alfred'...'wicked  calumnies'  ...'wicked  lies'...'wicked  woman'...to  accuse  her  'dear  husband'! 
282,geco,1-283,The  sooner  I  left  her  house  the  better. 
283,geco,1-284,So  I'm  off. 
284,geco,1-285,But  not  now? 
285,geco,1-286,This  minute! 
286,geco,1-287,For  a  moment  we  sat  and  stared  at  her. 
287,geco,1-288,"Finally  John  Cavendish,  finding  his  persuasions  of  no  avail,  went  off  to  look  up  the  trains. "
288,geco,1-289,"His  wife  followed  him,  murmuring  something  about  persuading  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  to  think  better  of  it. "
289,geco,1-290,"As  she  left  the  room,  Miss  Howard's  face  changed. "
290,geco,1-291,She  leant  towards  me  eagerly. 
291,geco,1-292,"mr  Hastings,  you're  honest. "
292,geco,1-293,I  can  trust  you? 
293,geco,1-294,I  was  a  little  startled. 
294,geco,1-295,"She  laid  her  hand  on  my  arm,  and  sank  her  voice  to  a  whisper. "
295,geco,1-296,"Look  after  her,  mr  Hastings. "
296,geco,1-297,My  poor  Emily. 
297,geco,1-298,They're  a  lot  of  sharks...all  of  them. 
298,geco,1-299,"Oh,  I  know  what  I'm  talking  about. "
299,geco,1-300,There  isn't  one  of  them  that's  not  hard  up  and  trying  to  get  money  out  of  her. 
300,geco,1-301,I've  protected  her  as  much  as  I  could. 
301,geco,1-302,"Now  I'm  out  of  the  way,  they'll  impose  upon  her. "
302,geco,1-303,"Of  course,  Miss  Howard,  I  said,  I'll  do  everything  I  can,  but  I'm  sure  you're  excited  and  overwrought. "
303,geco,1-304,She  interrupted  me  by  slowly  shaking  her  forefinger. 
304,geco,1-305,"Young  man,  trust  me. "
305,geco,1-306,I've  lived  in  the  world  rather  longer  than  you  have. 
306,geco,1-307,All  I  ask  you  is  to  keep  your  eyes  open. 
307,geco,1-308,You'll  see  what  I  mean. 
308,geco,1-309,"The  throb  of  the  motor  came  through  the  open  window,  and  Miss  Howard  rose  and  moved  to  the  door. "
309,geco,1-310,John's  voice  sounded  outside. 
310,geco,1-311,"With  her  hand  on  the  handle,  she  turned  her  head  over  her  shoulder,  and  beckoned  to  me. "
311,geco,1-312,"Above  all,  mr  Hastings,  watch  that  devil...her  husband! "
312,geco,1-313,There  was  no  time  for  more. 
313,geco,1-314,Miss  Howard  was  swallowed  up  in  an  eager  chorus  of  protests  and  good-byes. 
314,geco,1-315,The  Inglethorps  did  not  appear. 
315,geco,1-316,"As  the  motor  drove  away,  Mr.s.  Cavendish  suddenly  detached  herself  from  the  group,  and  moved  across  the  drive  to  the  lawn  to  meet  a  tall  bearded  man  who  had  been  evidently  making  for  the  house. "
316,geco,1-317,The  colour  rose  in  her  cheeks  as  she  held  out  her  hand  to  him. 
317,geco,1-318,"Who  is  that?  I  asked  sharply,  for  instinctively  I  distrusted  the  man. "
318,geco,1-319,"That's  Dr  Bauerstein,  said  John  shortly. "
319,geco,1-320,And  who  is  Dr  Bauerstein? 
320,geco,1-321,"He's  staying  in  the  village  doing  a  rest  cure,  after  a  bad  nervous  breakdown. "
321,geco,1-322,"He's  a  London  specialist;  a  very  clever  man...one  of  the  greatest  living  experts  on  poisons,  I  believe. "
322,geco,1-323,"And  he's  a  great  friend  of  Mary's,  put  in  Cynthia,  the  irrepressible. "
323,geco,1-324,John  Cavendish  frowned  and  changed  the  subject. 
324,geco,1-325,"Come  for  a  stroll,  Hastings. "
325,geco,1-326,This  has  been  a  most  rotten  business. 
326,geco,1-327,"She  always  had  a  rough  tongue,  but  there  is  no  stauncher  friend  in  England  than  Evelyn  Howard. "
327,geco,1-328,"He  took  the  path  through  the  plantation,  and  we  walked  down  to  the  village  through  the  woods  which  bordered  one  side  of  the  estate. "
328,geco,1-329,"As  we  passed  through  one  of  the  gates  on  our  way  home  again,  a  pretty  young  woman  of  gipsy  type  coming  in  the  opposite  direction  bowed  and  smiled. "
329,geco,1-330,"That's  a  pretty  girl,  I  remarked  appreciatively. "
330,geco,1-331,John's  face  hardened. 
331,geco,1-332,That  is  Mr.s.  Raikes. 
332,geco,1-333,The  one  that  Miss  Howard...... 
333,geco,1-334,"Exactly,  said  John,  with  rather  unnecessary  abruptness. "
334,geco,1-335,"I  thought  of  the  white-haired  old  lady  in  the  big  house,  and  that  vivid  wicked  little  face  that  had  just  smiled  into  ours,  and  a  vague  chill  of  foreboding  crept  over  me. "
335,geco,1-336,I  brushed  it  aside. 
336,geco,1-337,"Styles  is  really  a  glorious  old  place,  I  said  to  John. "
337,geco,1-338,He  nodded  rather  gloomily. 
338,geco,1-339,"Yes,  it's  a  fine  property. "
339,geco,1-340,"It'll  be  mine  some  day...should  be  mine  now  by  rights,  if  my  father  had  only  made  a  decent  will. "
340,geco,1-341,And  then  I  shouldn't  be  so  damned  hard  up  as  I  am  now. 
341,geco,1-342,"Hard  up,  are  you? "
342,geco,1-343,"My  dear  Hastings,  I  don't  mind  telling  you  that  I'm  at  my  wit's  end  for  money. "
343,geco,1-344,Couldn't  your  brother  help  you? 
344,geco,1-345,Lawrence? 
345,geco,1-346,"He's  gone  through  every  penny  he  ever  had,  publishing  rotten  verses  in  fancy  bindings. "
346,geco,1-347,"No,  we're  an  impecunious  lot. "
347,geco,1-348,"My  mother's  always  been  awfully  good  to  us,  I  must  say. "
348,geco,1-349,"That  is,  up  to  now. "
349,geco,1-350,"Since  her  marriage,  of  course......  he  broke  off,  frowning. "
350,geco,1-351,"For  the  first  time  I  felt  that,  with  Evelyn  Howard,  something  indefinable  had  gone  from  the  atmosphere. "
351,geco,1-352,Her  presence  had  spelt  security. 
352,geco,1-353,Now  that  security  was  removed...and  the  air  seemed  rife  with  suspicion. 
353,geco,1-354,The  sinister  face  of  Dr  Bauerstein  recurred  to  me  unpleasantly. 
354,geco,1-355,A  vague  suspicion  of  every  one  and  everything  filled  my  mind. 
355,geco,1-356,Just  for  a  moment  I  had  a  premonition  of  approaching  evil. 
356,geco,1-357,I  had  arrived  at  Styles  on  the  5th  of  July. 
357,geco,1-358,I  come  now  to  the  events  of  the  16th  and  17th  of  that  month. 
358,geco,1-359,For  the  convenience  of  the  reader  I  will  recapitulate  the  incidents  of  those  days  in  as  exact  a  manner  as  possible. 
359,geco,1-360,They  were  elicited  subsequently  at  the  trial  by  a  process  of  long  and  tedious  cross-examinations. 
360,geco,1-361,"I  received  a  letter  from  Evelyn  Howard  a  couple  of  days  after  her  departure,  telling  me  she  was  working  as  a  nurse  at  the  big  hospital  in  Middlingham,  a  manufacturing  town  some  fifteen  miles  away,  and  begging  me  to  let  her  know  if  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  should  show  any  wish  to  be  reconciled. "
361,geco,1-362,"The  only  fly  in  the  ointment  of  my  peaceful  days  was  Mr.s.  Cavendish's  extraordinary,  and,  for  my  part,  unaccountable  preference  for  the  society  of  Dr  Bauerstein. "
362,geco,1-363,"What  she  saw  in  the  man  I  cannot  imagine,  but  she  was  always  asking  him  up  to  the  house,  and  often  went  off  for  long  expeditions  with  him. "
363,geco,1-364,I  must  confess  that  I  was  quite  unable  to  see  his  attraction. 
364,geco,1-365,The  16th  of  July  fell  on  a  Monday. 
365,geco,1-366,It  was  a  day  of  turmoil. 
366,geco,1-367,"The  famous  bazaar  had  taken  place  on  Saturday,  and  an  entertainment,  in  connection  with  the  same  charity,  at  which  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  to  recite  a  War  poem,  was  to  be  held  that  night. "
367,geco,1-368,We  were  all  busy  during  the  morning  arranging  and  decorating  the  Hall  in  the  village  where  it  was  to  take  place. 
368,geco,1-369,We  had  a  late  luncheon  and  spent  the  afternoon  resting  in  the  garden. 
369,geco,1-370,I  noticed  that  John's  manner  was  somewhat  unusual. 
370,geco,1-371,He  seemed  very  excited  and  restless. 
371,geco,1-372,"After  tea,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  went  to  lie  down  to  rest  before  her  efforts  in  the  evening  and  I  challenged  Mary  Cavendish  to  a  single  at  tennis. "
372,geco,1-373,"About  a  quarter  to  seven,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  called  us  that  we  should  be  late  as  supper  was  early  that  night. "
373,geco,1-374,We  had  rather  a  scramble  to  get  ready  in  time;  and  before  the  meal  was  over  the  motor  was  waiting  at  the  door. 
374,geco,1-375,"The  entertainment  was  a  great  success,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  recitation  receiving  tremendous  applause. "
375,geco,1-376,There  were  also  some  tableaux  in  which  Cynthia  took  part. 
376,geco,1-377,"She  did  not  return  with  us,  having  been  asked  to  a  supper  party,  and  to  remain  the  night  with  some  friends  who  had  been  acting  with  her  in  the  tableaux. "
377,geco,1-378,"The  following  morning,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  stayed  in  bed  to  breakfast,  as  she  was  rather  overtired;  but  she  appeared  in  her  briskest  mood  about  12.30, "
378,geco,1-379,and  swept  Lawrence  and  myself  off  to  a  luncheon  party. 
379,geco,1-380,Such  a  charming  invitation  from  Mr.s.  Rolleston. 
380,geco,1-381,"Lady  Tadminster's  sister,  you  know. "
381,geco,1-382,The  Rollestons  came  over  with  the  Conqueror...one  of  our  oldest  families. 
382,geco,1-383,Mary  had  excused  herself  on  the  plea  of  an  engagement  with  Dr  Bauerstein. 
383,geco,1-384,"We  had  a  pleasant  luncheon,  and  as  we  drove  away  Lawrence  suggested  that  we  should  return  by  Tadminster,  which  was  barely  a  mile  out  of  our  way,  and  pay  a  visit  to  Cynthia  in  her  dispensary. "
384,geco,1-385,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  replied  that  this  was  an  excellent  idea,  but  as  she  had  several  letters  to  write  she  would  drop  us  there,  and  we  could  come  back  with  Cynthia  in  the  pony-trap. "
385,geco,1-386,"We  were  detained  under  suspicion  by  the  hospital  porter,  until  Cynthia  appeared  to  vouch  for  us,  looking  very  cool  and  sweet  in  her  long  white  overall. "
386,geco,1-387,"She  took  us  up  to  her  sanctum,  and  introduced  us  to  her  fellow  dispenser,  a  rather  awe-inspiring  individual,  whom  Cynthia  cheerily  addressed  as  'Nibs'. "
387,geco,1-388,What  a  lot  of  bottles! 
388,geco,1-389,"I  exclaimed,  as  my  eye  travelled  round  the  small  room. "
389,geco,1-390,Do  you  really  know  what's  in  them  all? 
390,geco,1-391,"Say  something  original,  groaned  Cynthia. "
391,geco,1-392,Every  single  person  who  comes  up  here  says  that. 
392,geco,1-393,We  are  really  thinking  of  bestowing  a  prize  on  the  first  individual  who  does  not  say:  'What  a  lot  of  bottles!' 
393,geco,1-394,And  I  know  the  next  thing  you're  going  to  say  is:  'How  many  people  have  you  poisoned?' 
394,geco,1-395,I  pleaded  guilty  with  a  laugh. 
395,geco,1-396,"If  you  people  only  knew  how  fatally  easy  it  is  to  poison  some  one  by  mistake,  you  wouldn't  joke  about  it. "
396,geco,1-397,"Come  on,  let's  have  tea. "
397,geco,1-398,We've  got  all  sorts  of  secret  stories  in  that  cupboard. 
398,geco,1-399,"No,  Lawrence...that's  the  poison  cupboard. "
399,geco,1-400,The  big  cupboard...that's  right. 
400,geco,1-401,"We  had  a  very  cheery  tea,  and  assisted  Cynthia  to  wash  up  afterwards. "
401,geco,1-402,We  had  just  put  away  the  last  tea-spoon  when  a  knock  came  at  the  door. 
402,geco,1-403,The  countenances  of  Cynthia  and  Nibs  were  suddenly  petrified  into  a  stern  and  forbidding  expression. 
403,geco,1-404,"Come  in,  said  Cynthia,  in  a  sharp  professional  tone. "
404,geco,1-405,"A  young  and  rather  scared  looking  nurse  appeared  with  a  bottle  which  she  proffered  to  Nibs,  who  waved  her  towards  Cynthia  with  the  somewhat  enigmatical  remark:  I'm  not  really  here  today. "
405,geco,1-406,Cynthia  took  the  bottle  and  examined  it  with  the  severity  of  a  judge. 
406,geco,1-407,This  should  have  been  sent  up  this  morning. 
407,geco,1-408,Sister  is  very  sorry. 
408,geco,1-409,She  forgot. 
409,geco,1-410,Sister  should  read  the  rules  outside  the  door. 
410,geco,1-411,I  gathered  from  the  little  nurse's  expression  that  there  was  not  the  least  likelihood  of  her  having  the  hardihood  to  retail  this  message  to  the  dreaded  'Sister'. 
411,geco,1-412,"So  now  it  can't  be  done  until  tomorrow,  finished  Cynthia. "
412,geco,1-413,Don't  you  think  you  could  possibly  let  us  have  it  tonight? 
413,geco,1-414,"Well,  said  Cynthia  graciously,  we  are  very  busy,  but  if  we  have  time  it  shall  be  done. "
414,geco,1-415,"The  little  nurse  withdrew,  and  Cynthia  promptly  took  a  jar  from  the  shelf,  refilled  the  bottle,  and  placed  it  on  the  table  outside  the  door. "
415,geco,1-416,I  laughed. 
416,geco,1-417,Discipline  must  be  maintained? 
417,geco,1-418,Exactly. 
418,geco,1-419,Come  out  on  our  little  balcony. 
419,geco,1-420,You  can  see  all  the  outside  wards  there. 
420,geco,1-421,I  followed  Cynthia  and  her  friend  and  they  pointed  out  the  different  wards  to  me. 
421,geco,1-422,"Lawrence  remained  behind,  but  after  a  few  moments  Cynthia  called  to  him  over  her  shoulder  to  come  and  join  us. "
422,geco,1-423,Then  she  looked  at  her  watch. 
423,geco,1-424,"Nothing  more  to  do,  Nibs? "
424,geco,1-425,No. 
425,geco,1-426,All  right. 
426,geco,1-427,Then  we  can  lock  up  and  go. 
427,geco,1-428,I  had  seen  Lawrence  in  quite  a  different  light  that  afternoon. 
428,geco,1-429,"Compared  to  John,  he  was  an  astoundingly  difficult  person  to  get  to  know. "
429,geco,1-430,"He  was  the  opposite  of  his  brother  in  almost  every  respect,  being  unusually  shy  and  reserved. "
430,geco,1-431,"Yet  he  had  a  certain  charm  of  manner,  and  I  fancied  that,  if  one  really  knew  him  well,  one  could  have  a  deep  affection  for  him. "
431,geco,1-432,"I  had  always  fancied  that  his  manner  to  Cynthia  was  rather  constrained,  and  that  she  on  her  side  was  inclined  to  be  shy  of  him. "
432,geco,1-433,"But  they  were  both  gay  enough  this  afternoon,  and  chatted  together  like  a  couple  of  children. "
433,geco,1-434,"As  we  drove  through  the  village,  I  remembered  that  I  wanted  some  stamps,  so  accordingly  we  pulled  up  at  the  post  office. "
434,geco,1-435,"As  I  came  out  again,  I  cannoned  into  a  little  man  who  was  just  entering. "
435,geco,1-436,"I  drew  aside  and  apologised,  when  suddenly,  with  a  loud  exclamation,  he  clasped  me  in  his  arms  and  kissed  me  warmly. "
436,geco,1-437,Mon  ami  Hastings!  he  cried. 
437,geco,1-438,It  is  indeed  mon  ami  Hastings! 
438,geco,1-439,Poirot! 
439,geco,1-440,I  exclaimed. 
440,geco,1-441,I  turned  to  the  pony-trap. 
441,geco,1-442,"This  is  a  very  pleasant  meeting  for  me,  Miss  Cynthia. "
442,geco,1-443,"This  is  my  old  friend,  Monsieur  Poirot,  whom  I  have  not  seen  for  years. "
443,geco,1-444,"Oh,  we  know  Monsieur  Poirot,  said  Cynthia  gaily. "
444,geco,1-445,But  I  had  no  idea  he  was  a  friend  of  yours. 
445,geco,1-446,"Yes,  indeed,  said  Poirot  seriously. "
446,geco,1-447,I  know  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. 
447,geco,1-448,It  is  by  the  charity  of  that  good  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  that  I  am  here. 
448,geco,1-449,"Then,  as  I  looked  at  him  inquiringly:  Yes,  my  friend,  she  had  kindly  extended  hospitality  to  seven  of  my  countrypeople  who,  alas,  are  refugees  from  their  native  land. "
449,geco,1-450,We  Belgians  will  always  remember  her  with  gratitude. 
450,geco,1-451,Poirot  was  an  extraordinary  looking  little  man. 
451,geco,1-452,"He  was  hardly  more  than  five  feet,  four  inches,  but  carried  himself  with  great  dignity. "
452,geco,1-453,"His  head  was  exactly  the  shape  of  an  egg,  and  he  always  perched  it  a  little  on  one  side. "
453,geco,1-454,His  moustache  was  very  stiff  and  military. 
454,geco,1-455,The  neatness  of  his  attire  was  almost  incredible. 
455,geco,1-456,I  believe  a  speck  of  dust  would  have  caused  him  more  pain  than  a  bullet  wound. 
456,geco,1-457,"Yet  this  quaint  dandyfied  little  man  who,  I  was  sorry  to  see,  now  limped  badly,  had  been  in  his  time  one  of  the  most  celebrated  members  of  the  Belgian  police. "
457,geco,1-458,"As  a  detective,  his  flair  had  been  extraordinary,  and  he  had  achieved  triumphs  by  unravelling  some  of  the  most  baffling  cases  of  the  day. "
458,geco,1-459,"He  pointed  out  to  me  the  little  house  inhabited  by  him  and  his  fellow  Belgians,  and  I  promised  to  go  and  see  him  at  an  early  date. "
459,geco,1-460,"Then  he  raised  his  hat  with  a  flourish  to  Cynthia,  and  we  drove  away. "
460,geco,1-461,"He's  a  dear  little  man,  said  Cynthia. "
461,geco,1-462,I'd  no  idea  you  knew  him. 
462,geco,1-463,"You've  been  entertaining  a  celebrity  unawares,  I  replied. "
463,geco,1-464,"And,  for  the  rest  of  the  way  home,  I  recited  to  them  the  various  exploits  and  triumphs  of  Hercule  Poirot. "
464,geco,1-465,We  arrived  back  in  a  very  cheerful  mood. 
465,geco,1-466,"As  we  entered  the  hall,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  came  out  of  her  boudoir. "
466,geco,1-467,She  looked  flushed  and  upset. 
467,geco,1-468,"Oh,  it's  you,  she  said. "
468,geco,1-469,"Is  there  anything  the  matter,  Aunt  Emily?  asked  Cynthia. "
469,geco,1-470,"Certainly  not,  said  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  sharply. "
470,geco,1-471,What  should  there  be? 
471,geco,1-472,"Then  catching  sight  of  Dorcas,  the  parlourmaid,  going  into  the  dining-room,  she  called  to  her  to  bring  some  stamps  into  the  boudoir. "
472,geco,1-473,"Yes,  m'm. "
473,geco,1-474,"The  old  servant  hesitated,  then  added  diffidently:  Don't  you  think,  m'm,  you'd  better  get  to  bed? "
474,geco,1-475,You're  looking  very  tired. 
475,geco,1-476,"Perhaps  you're  right,  Dorcas...yes...no...not  now. "
476,geco,1-477,I've  some  letters  I  must  finish  by  post-time. 
477,geco,1-478,Have  you  lighted  the  fire  in  my  room  as  I  told  you? 
478,geco,1-479,"Yes,  m'm. "
479,geco,1-480,Then  I'll  go  to  bed  directly  after  supper. 
480,geco,1-481,"She  went  into  the  boudoir  again,  and  Cynthia  stared  after  her. "
481,geco,1-482,Goodness  gracious! 
482,geco,1-483,I  wonder  what's  up?  she  said  to  Lawrence. 
483,geco,1-484,"He  did  not  seem  to  have  heard  her,  for  without  a  word  he  turned  on  his  heel  and  went  out  of  the  house. "
484,geco,1-485,"I  suggested  a  quick  game  of  tennis  before  supper  and,  Cynthia  agreeing,  I  ran  upstairs  to  fetch  my  racquet. "
485,geco,1-486,Mr.s.  Cavendish  was  coming  down  the  stairs. 
486,geco,1-487,"It  may  have  been  my  fancy,  but  she,  too,  was  looking  odd  and  disturbed. "
487,geco,1-488,"Had  a  good  walk  with  Dr  Bauerstein?  I  asked,  trying  to  appear  as  indifferent  as  I  could. "
488,geco,1-489,"I  didn't  go,  she  replied  abruptly. "
489,geco,1-490,Where  is  Mr.s.  Inglethorp? 
490,geco,1-491,In  the  boudoir. 
491,geco,1-492,"Her  hand  clenched  itself  on  the  banisters,  then  she  seemed  to  nerve  herself  for  some  encounter,  and  went  rapidly  past  me  down  the  stairs  across  the  hall  to  the  boudoir,  the  door  of  which  she  shut  behind  her. "
492,geco,1-493,"As  I  ran  out  to  the  tennis  court  a  few  moments  later,  I  had  to  pass  the  open  boudoir  window,  and  was  unable  to  help  overhearing  the  following  scrap  of  dialogue. "
493,geco,1-494,Mary  Cavendish  was  saying  in  the  voice  of  a  woman  desperately  controlling  herself:  Then  you  won't  show  it  to  me? 
494,geco,1-495,"To  which  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  replied:  My  dear  Mary,  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  that  matter. "
495,geco,1-496,Then  show  it  to  me. 
496,geco,1-497,I  tell  you  it  is  not  what  you  imagine. 
497,geco,1-498,It  does  not  concern  you  in  the  least. 
498,geco,1-499,"To  which  Mary  Cavendish  replied,  with  a  rising  bitterness:  Of  course,  I  might  have  known  you  would  shield  him. "
499,geco,1-500,"Cynthia  was  waiting  for  me,  and  greeted  me  eagerly  with:  I  say! "
500,geco,1-501,There's  been  the  most  awful  row! 
501,geco,1-502,I've  got  it  all  out  of  Dorcas. 
502,geco,1-503,What  kind  of  a  row? 
503,geco,1-504,Between  Aunt  Emily  and  him. 
504,geco,1-505,I  do  hope  she's  found  him  out  at  last! 
505,geco,1-506,"Was  Dorcas  there,  then? "
506,geco,1-507,Of  course  not. 
507,geco,1-508,She  'happened  to  be  near  the  door'. 
508,geco,1-509,It  was  a  real  old  bust-up. 
509,geco,1-510,I  do  wish  I  knew  what  it  was  all  about. 
510,geco,1-511,"I  thought  of  Mr.s.  Raikes's  gipsy  face,  and  Evelyn  Howard's  warnings,  but  wisely  decided  to  hold  my  peace,  whilst  Cynthia  exhausted  every  possible  hypothesis,  and  cheerfully  hoped,  Aunt  Emily  will  send  him  away,  and  will  never  speak  to  him  again. "
511,geco,1-512,"I  was  anxious  to  get  hold  of  John,  but  he  was  nowhere  to  be  seen. "
512,geco,1-513,Evidently  something  very  momentous  had  occurred  that  afternoon. 
513,geco,1-514,"I  tried  to  forget  the  few  words  I  had  overheard;  but,  do  what  I  would,  I  could  not  dismiss  them  altogether  from  my  mind. "
514,geco,1-515,What  was  Mary  Cavendish's  concern  in  the  matter? 
515,geco,1-516,mr  Inglethorp  was  in  the  drawing-room  when  I  came  down  to  supper. 
516,geco,1-517,"His  face  was  impassive  as  ever,  and  the  strange  unreality  of  the  man  struck  me  afresh. "
517,geco,1-518,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  came  down  last. 
518,geco,1-519,"She  still  looked  agitated,  and  during  the  meal  there  was  a  somewhat  constrained  silence. "
519,geco,1-520,Inglethorp  was  unusually  quiet. 
520,geco,1-521,"As  a  rule,  he  surrounded  his  wife  with  little  attentions,  placing  a  cushion  at  her  back,  and  altogether  playing  the  part  of  the  devoted  husband. "
521,geco,1-522,"Immediately  after  supper,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  retired  to  her  boudoir  again. "
522,geco,1-523,"Send  my  coffee  in  here,  Mary,  she  called. "
523,geco,1-524,I've  just  five  minutes  to  catch  the  post. 
524,geco,1-525,Cynthia  and  I  went  and  sat  by  the  open  window  in  the  drawing-room. 
525,geco,1-526,Mary  Cavendish  brought  our  coffee  to  us. 
526,geco,1-527,She  seemed  excited. 
527,geco,1-528,"Do  you  young  people  want  lights,  or  do  you  enjoy  the  twilight?  she  asked. "
528,geco,1-529,"Will  you  take  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  her  coffee,  Cynthia? "
529,geco,1-530,I  will  pour  it  out. 
530,geco,1-531,"Do  not  trouble,  Mary,  said  Inglethorp. "
531,geco,1-532,I  will  take  it  to  Emily. 
532,geco,1-533,"He  poured  it  out,  and  went  out  of  the  room  carrying  it  carefully. "
533,geco,1-534,"Lawrence  followed  him,  and  Mr.s.  Cavendish  sat  down  by  us. "
534,geco,1-535,We  three  sat  for  some  time  in  silence. 
535,geco,1-536,"It  was  a  glorious  night,  hot  and  still. "
536,geco,1-537,Mr.s.  Cavendish  fanned  herself  gently  with  a  palm  leaf. 
537,geco,1-538,"It's  almost  too  hot,  she  murmured. "
538,geco,1-539,We  shall  have  a  thunderstorm. 
539,geco,1-540,"Alas,  that  these  harmonious  moments  can  never  endure! "
540,geco,1-541,"My  paradise  was  rudely  shattered  by  the  sound  of  a  well  known,  and  heartily  disliked,  voice  in  the  hall. "
541,geco,1-542,Dr  Bauerstein! 
542,geco,1-543,exclaimed  Cynthia. 
543,geco,1-544,What  a  funny  time  to  come. 
544,geco,1-545,"I  glanced  jealously  at  Mary  Cavendish,  but  she  seemed  quite  undisturbed,  the  delicate  pallor  of  her  cheeks  did  not  vary. "
545,geco,1-546,"In  a  few  moments,  Alfred  Inglethorp  had  ushered  the  doctor  in,  the  latter  laughing,  and  protesting  that  he  was  in  no  fit  state  for  a  drawing-room. "
546,geco,1-547,"In  truth,  he  presented  a  sorry  spectacle,  being  literally  plastered  with  mud. "
547,geco,1-548,"What  have  you  been  doing,  doctor?  cried  Mr.s.  Cavendish. "
548,geco,1-549,"I  must  make  my  apologies,  said  the  doctor. "
549,geco,1-550,"I  did  not  really  mean  to  come  in,  but  mr  Inglethorp  insisted. "
550,geco,1-551,"Well,  Bauerstein,  you  are  in  a  plight,  said  John,  strolling  in  from  the  hall. "
551,geco,1-552,"Have  some  coffee,  and  tell  us  what  you  have  been  up  to. "
552,geco,1-553,"Thank  you,  I  will. "
553,geco,1-554,"He  laughed  rather  ruefully,  as  he  described  how  he  had  discovered  a  very  rare  species  of  fern  in  an  inaccessible  place,  and  in  his  efforts  to  obtain  it  had  lost  his  footing,  and  slipped  ignominiously  into  a  neighbouring  pond. "
554,geco,1-555,"The  sun  soon  dried  me  off,  he  added,  but  I'm  afraid  my  appearance  is  very  disreputable. "
555,geco,1-556,"At  this  juncture,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  called  to  Cynthia  from  the  hall,  and  the  girl  ran  out. "
556,geco,1-557,"Just  carry  up  my  despatch-case,  will  you,  dear? "
557,geco,1-558,I'm  going  to  bed. 
558,geco,1-559,The  door  into  the  hall  was  a  wide  one. 
559,geco,1-560,"I  had  risen  when  Cynthia  did,  John  was  close  by  me. "
560,geco,1-561,"There  were  therefore  three  witnesses  who  could  swear  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  carrying  her  coffee,  as  yet  untasted,  in  her  hand. "
561,geco,1-562,My  evening  was  utterly  and  entirely  spoilt  by  the  presence  of  Dr  Bauerstein. 
562,geco,1-563,It  seemed  to  me  the  man  would  never  go. 
563,geco,1-564,"He  rose  at  last,  however,  and  I  breathed  a  sigh  of  relief. "
564,geco,1-565,"I'll  walk  down  to  the  village  with  you,  said  mr  Inglethorp. "
565,geco,1-566,I  must  see  our  agent  over  those  estate  accounts. 
566,geco,1-567,He  turned  to  John. 
567,geco,1-568,No  one  need  sit  up. 
568,geco,1-569,I  will  take  the  latch-key. 
569,geco,1-570,"To  make  this  part  of  my  story  clear,  I  append  the  following  plan  of  the  first  floor  of  Styles. "
570,geco,1-571,The  servants'  rooms  are  reached  through  the  door  B. 
571,geco,1-572,"They  have  no  communication  with  the  right  wing,  where  the  Inglethorps'  rooms  were  situated. "
572,geco,1-573,It  seemed  to  be  the  middle  of  the  night  when  I  was  awakened  by  Lawrence  Cavendish. 
573,geco,1-574,"He  had  a  candle  in  his  hand,  and  the  agitation  of  his  face  told  me  at  once  that  something  was  seriously  wrong. "
574,geco,1-575,"What's  the  matter?  I  asked,  sitting  up  in  bed,  and  trying  to  collect  my  scattered  thoughts. "
575,geco,1-576,We  are  afraid  my  mother  is  very  ill. 
576,geco,1-577,She  seems  to  be  having  some  kind  of  fit. 
577,geco,1-578,Unfortunately  she  has  locked  herself  in. 
578,geco,1-579,I'll  come  at  once. 
579,geco,1-580,"I  sprang  out  of  bed;  and,  pulling  on  a  dressing-gown,  followed  Lawrence  along  the  passage  and  the  gallery  to  the  right  wing  of  the  house. "
580,geco,1-581,"John  Cavendish  joined  us,  and  one  or  two  of  the  servants  were  standing  round  in  a  state  of  awe-stricken  excitement. "
581,geco,1-582,Lawrence  turned  to  his  brother. 
582,geco,1-583,What  do  you  think  we  had  better  do? 
583,geco,1-584,"Never,  I  thought,  had  his  indecision  of  character  been  more  apparent. "
584,geco,1-585,"John  rattled  the  handle  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  door  violently,  but  with  no  effect. "
585,geco,1-586,It  was  obviously  locked  or  bolted  on  the  inside. 
586,geco,1-587,The  whole  household  was  aroused  by  now. 
587,geco,1-588,The  most  alarming  sounds  were  audible  from  the  interior  of  the  room. 
588,geco,1-589,Clearly  something  must  be  done. 
589,geco,1-590,"Try  going  through  mr  Inglethorp's  room,  sir,  cried  Dorcas. "
590,geco,1-591,"Oh,  the  poor  mistress! "
591,geco,1-592,Suddenly  I  realized  that  Alfred  Inglethorp  was  not  with  us...that  he  alone  had  given  no  sign  of  his  presence. 
592,geco,1-593,John  opened  the  door  of  his  room. 
593,geco,1-594,"It  was  pitch  dark,  but  Lawrence  was  following  with  the  candle,  and  by  its  feeble  light  we  saw  that  the  bed  had  not  been  slept  in,  and  that  there  was  no  sign  of  the  room  having  been  occupied. "
594,geco,1-595,We  went  straight  to  the  connecting  door. 
595,geco,1-596,"That,  too,  was  locked  or  bolted  on  the  inside. "
596,geco,1-597,What  was  to  be  done? 
597,geco,1-598,"Oh,  dear,  sir,  cried  Dorcas,  wringing  her  hands,  what  ever  shall  we  do? "
598,geco,1-599,"We  must  try  and  break  the  door  in,  I  suppose. "
599,geco,1-600,"It'll  be  a  tough  job,  though. "
600,geco,1-601,"Here,  let  one  of  the  maids  go  down  and  wake  Baily  and  tell  him  to  go  for  Dr  Wilkins  at  once. "
601,geco,1-602,"Now  then,  we'll  have  a  try  at  the  door. "
602,geco,1-603,"Half  a  moment,  though,  isn't  there  a  door  into  Miss  Cynthia's  rooms? "
603,geco,1-604,"Yes,  sir,  but  that's  always  bolted. "
604,geco,1-605,It's  never  been  undone. 
605,geco,1-606,"Well,  we  might  just  see. "
606,geco,1-607,He  ran  rapidly  down  the  corridor  to  Cynthia's  room. 
607,geco,1-608,"Mary  Cavendish  was  there,  shaking  the  girl,  who  must  have  been  an  unusually  sound  sleeper,  and  trying  to  wake  her. "
608,geco,1-609,In  a  moment  or  two  he  was  back. 
609,geco,1-610,No  good. 
610,geco,1-611,That's  bolted  too. 
611,geco,1-612,We  must  break  in  the  door. 
612,geco,1-613,I  think  this  one  is  a  shade  less  solid  than  the  one  in  the  passage. 
613,geco,1-614,We  strained  and  heaved  together. 
614,geco,1-615,"The  framework  of  the  door  was  solid,  and  for  a  long  time  it  resisted  our  efforts,  but  at  last  we  felt  it  give  beneath  our  weight,  and  finally,  with  a  resounding  crash,  it  was  burst  open. "
615,geco,1-616,"We  stumbled  in  together,  Lawrence  still  holding  his  candle. "
616,geco,1-617,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  lying  on  the  bed,  her  whole  form  agitated  by  violent  convulsions,  in  one  of  which  she  must  have  overturned  the  table  beside  her. "
617,geco,1-618,"As  we  entered,  however,  her  limbs  relaxed,  and  she  fell  back  upon  the  pillows. "
618,geco,1-619,"John  strode  across  the  room,  and  lit  the  gas. "
619,geco,1-620,"Turning  to  Annie,  one  of  the  housemaids,  he  sent  her  downstairs  to  the  dining-room  for  brandy. "
620,geco,1-621,Then  he  went  across  to  his  mother  whilst  I  unbolted  the  door  that  gave  on  the  corridor. 
621,geco,1-622,"I  turned  to  Lawrence,  to  suggest  that  I  had  better  leave  them  now  that  there  was  no  further  need  of  my  services,  but  the  words  were  frozen  on  my  lips. "
622,geco,1-623,Never  have  I  seen  such  a  ghastly  look  on  any  man's  face. 
623,geco,1-624,"He  was  white  as  chalk,  the  candle  he  held  in  his  shaking  hand  was  sputtering  onto  the  carpet,  and  his  eyes,  petrified  with  terror,  or  some  such  kindred  emotion,  stared  fixedly  over  my  head  at  a  point  on  the  further  wall. "
624,geco,1-625,It  was  as  though  he  had  seen  something  that  turned  him  to  stone. 
625,geco,1-626,"I  instinctively  followed  the  direction  of  his  eyes,  but  I  could  see  nothing  unusual. "
626,geco,1-627,"The  still  feebly  flickering  ashes  in  the  grate,  and  the  row  of  prim  ornaments  on  the  mantelpiece,  were  surely  harmless  enough. "
627,geco,1-628,The  violence  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  attack  seemed  to  be  passing. 
628,geco,1-629,She  was  able  to  speak  in  short  gasps. 
629,geco,1-630,Better  now...very  sudden...stupid  of  me...to  lock  myself  in. 
630,geco,1-631,"A  shadow  fell  on  the  bed  and,  looking  up,  I  saw  Mary  Cavendish  standing  near  the  door  with  her  arm  around  Cynthia. "
631,geco,1-632,"She  seemed  to  be  supporting  the  girl,  who  looked  utterly  dazed  and  unlike  herself. "
632,geco,1-633,"Her  face  was  heavily  flushed,  and  she  yawned  repeatedly. "
633,geco,1-634,"Poor  Cynthia  is  quite  frightened,  said  Mr.s.  Cavendish  in  a  low  clear  voice. "
634,geco,1-635,"She  herself,  I  noticed,  was  dressed  in  her  white  land  smock. "
635,geco,1-636,Then  it  must  be  later  than  I  thought. 
636,geco,1-637,"I  saw  that  a  faint  streak  of  daylight  was  showing  through  the  curtains  of  the  windows,  and  that  the  clock  on  the  mantelpiece  pointed  to  close  upon  five  o'clock. "
637,geco,1-638,A  strangled  cry  from  the  bed  startled  me. 
638,geco,1-639,A  fresh  access  of  pain  seized  the  unfortunate  old  lady. 
639,geco,1-640,The  convulsions  were  of  a  violence  terrible  to  behold. 
640,geco,1-641,Everything  was  confusion. 
641,geco,1-642,"We  thronged  round  her,  powerless  to  help  or  alleviate. "
642,geco,1-643,"A  final  convulsion  lifted  her  from  the  bed,  until  she  appeared  to  rest  upon  her  head  and  her  heels,  with  her  body  arched  in  an  extraordinary  manner. "
643,geco,1-644,In  vain  Mary  and  John  tried  to  administer  more  brandy. 
644,geco,1-645,The  moments  flew. 
645,geco,1-646,Again  the  body  arched  itself  in  that  peculiar  fashion. 
646,geco,1-647,"At  that  moment,  Dr  Bauerstein  pushed  his  way  authoritatively  into  the  room. "
647,geco,1-648,"For  one  instant  he  stopped  dead,  staring  at  the  figure  on  the  bed,  and,  at  the  same  instant,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  cried  out  in  a  strangled  voice,  her  eyes  fixed  on  the  doctor:  Alfred...Alfred......  Then  she  fell  back  motionless  on  the  pillows. "
648,geco,1-649,"With  a  stride,  the  doctor  reached  the  bed,  and  seizing  her  arms  worked  them  energetically,  applying  what  I  knew  to  be  artificial  respiration. "
649,geco,1-650,He  issued  a  few  short  sharp  orders  to  the  servants. 
650,geco,1-651,An  imperious  wave  of  his  hand  drove  us  all  to  the  door. 
651,geco,1-652,"We  watched  him,  fascinated,  though  I  think  we  all  knew  in  our  hearts  that  it  was  too  late,  and  that  nothing  could  be  done  now. "
652,geco,1-653,I  could  see  by  the  expression  on  his  face  that  he  himself  had  little  hope. 
653,geco,1-654,"Finally  he  abandoned  his  task,  shaking  his  head  gravely. "
654,geco,1-655,"At  that  moment,  we  heard  footsteps  outside,  and  Dr  Wilkins,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  own  doctor,  a  portly,  fussy  little  man,  came  bustling  in. "
655,geco,1-656,"In  a  few  words  DrBauerstein  explained  how  he  had  happened  to  be  passing  the  lodge  gates  as  the  car  came  out,  and  had  run  up  to  the  house  as  fast  as  he  could,  whilst  the  car  went  on  to  fetch  Dr  Wilkins. "
656,geco,1-657,"With  a  faint  gesture  of  the  hand,  he  indicated  the  figure  on  the  bed. "
657,geco,1-658,Very  sad. 
658,geco,1-659,"Very  sad,  murmured  Dr  Wilkins. "
659,geco,1-660,Poor  dear  lady. 
660,geco,1-661,Always  did  far  too  much...far  too  much...against  my  advice. 
661,geco,1-662,I  warned  her. 
662,geco,1-663,Her  heart  was  far  from  strong. 
663,geco,1-664,"Take  it  easy,'  I  said  to  her,  Take...it...easy'. "
664,geco,1-665,But  no...her  zeal  for  good  works  was  too  great. 
665,geco,1-666,Nature  rebelled. 
666,geco,1-667,Nature...rebelled. 
667,geco,1-668,"Dr  Bauerstein,  I  noticed,  was  watching  the  local  doctor  narrowly. "
668,geco,1-669,He  still  kept  his  eyes  fixed  on  him  as  he  spoke. 
669,geco,1-670,"The  convulsions  were  of  a  peculiar  violence,  Dr  Wilkins. "
670,geco,1-671,I  am  sorry  you  were  not  here  in  time  to  witness  them. 
671,geco,1-672,They  were  quite...tetanic  in  character. 
672,geco,1-673,Ah!  said  Dr  Wilkins  wisely. 
673,geco,1-674,"I  should  like  to  speak  to  you  in  private,  said  Dr  Bauerstein. "
674,geco,1-675,He  turned  to  John. 
675,geco,1-676,You  do  not  object? 
676,geco,1-677,Certainly  not. 
677,geco,1-678,"We  all  trooped  out  into  the  corridor,  leaving  the  two  doctors  alone,  and  I  heard  the  key  turned  in  the  lock  behind  us. "
678,geco,1-679,We  went  slowly  down  the  stairs. 
679,geco,1-680,I  was  violently  excited. 
680,geco,1-681,"I  have  a  certain  talent  for  deduction,  and  Dr  Bauerstein's  manner  had  started  a  flock  of  wild  surmises  in  my  mind. "
681,geco,1-682,Mary  Cavendish  laid  her  hand  upon  my  arm. 
682,geco,1-683,What  is  it? 
683,geco,1-684,Why  did  Dr  Bauerstein  seem  so...peculiar? 
684,geco,1-685,I  looked  at  her. 
685,geco,1-686,Do  you  know  what  I  think? 
686,geco,1-687,What? 
687,geco,1-688,Listen! 
688,geco,1-689,"I  looked  round,  the  others  were  out  of  earshot. "
689,geco,1-690,I  lowered  my  voice  to  a  whisper. 
690,geco,1-691,I  believe  she  has  been  poisoned! 
691,geco,1-692,I'm  certain  Dr  Bauerstein  suspects  it. 
692,geco,1-693,What? 
693,geco,1-694,"She  shrank  against  the  wall,  the  pupils  of  her  eyes  dilating  wildly. "
694,geco,1-695,"Then,  with  a  sudden  cry  that  startled  me,  she  cried  out:  No,  no...not  that...not  that! "
695,geco,1-696,"And  breaking  from  me,  fled  up  the  stairs. "
696,geco,1-697,"I  followed  her,  afraid  that  she  was  going  to  faint. "
697,geco,1-698,"I  found  her  leaning  against  the  bannisters,  deadly  pale. "
698,geco,1-699,She  waved  me  away  impatiently. 
699,geco,1-700,"No,  no...leave  me. "
700,geco,1-701,I'd  rather  be  alone. 
701,geco,1-702,Let  me  just  be  quiet  for  a  minute  or  two. 
702,geco,1-703,Go  down  to  the  others. 
703,geco,1-704,I  obeyed  her  reluctantly. 
704,geco,1-705,John  and  Lawrence  were  in  the  dining-room. 
705,geco,1-706,I  joined  them. 
706,geco,1-707,"We  were  all  silent,  but  I  suppose  I  voiced  the  thoughts  of  us  all  when  I  at  last  broke  it  by  saying:  Where  is  mr  Inglethorp? "
707,geco,1-708,John  shook  his  head. 
708,geco,1-709,He's  not  in  the  house. 
709,geco,1-710,Our  eyes  met. 
710,geco,1-711,Where  was  Alfred  Inglethorp? 
711,geco,1-712,His  absence  was  strange  and  inexplicable. 
712,geco,1-713,I  remembered  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  dying  words. 
713,geco,1-714,What  lay  beneath  them? 
714,geco,1-715,"What  more  could  she  have  told  us,  if  she  had  had  time? "
715,geco,1-716,At  last  we  heard  the  doctors  descending  the  stairs. 
716,geco,1-717,"Dr  Wilkins  was  looking  important  and  excited,  and  trying  to  conceal  an  inward  exultation  under  a  manner  of  decorous  calm. "
717,geco,1-718,"Dr  Bauerstein  remained  in  the  background,  his  grave  bearded  face  unchanged. "
718,geco,1-719,Dr  Wilkins  was  the  spokesman  for  the  two. 
719,geco,1-720,"He  addressed  himself  to  John:  mr  Cavendish,  I  should  like  your  consent  to  a  postmortem. "
720,geco,1-721,Is  that  necessary?  asked  John  gravely. 
721,geco,1-722,A  spasm  of  pain  crossed  his  face. 
722,geco,1-723,"Absolutely,  said  Dr  Bauerstein. "
723,geco,1-724,You  mean  by  that......? 
724,geco,1-725,That  neither  Dr  Wilkins  nor  myself  could  give  a  death  certificate  under  the  circumstances. 
725,geco,1-726,John  bent  his  head. 
726,geco,1-727,"In  that  case,  I  have  no  alternative  but  to  agree. "
727,geco,1-728,"Thank  you,  said  Dr  Wilkins  briskly. "
728,geco,1-729,We  propose  that  it  should  take  place  tomorrow  night...or  rather  tonight. 
729,geco,1-730,And  he  glanced  at  the  daylight. 
730,geco,1-731,"Under  the  circumstances,  I  am  afraid  an  inquest  can  hardly  be  avoided...these  formalities  are  necessary,  but  I  beg  that  you  won't  distress  yourselves. "
731,geco,1-732,"There  was  a  pause,  and  then  Dr  Bauerstein  drew  two  keys  from  his  pocket,  and  handed  them  to  John. "
732,geco,1-733,These  are  the  keys  of  the  two  rooms. 
733,geco,1-734,"I  have  locked  them  and,  in  my  opinion,  they  would  be  better  kept  locked  for  the  present. "
734,geco,1-735,The  doctors  then  departed. 
735,geco,1-736,"I  had  been  turning  over  an  idea  in  my  head,  and  I  felt  that  the  moment  had  now  come  to  broach  it. "
736,geco,1-737,Yet  I  was  a  little  chary  of  doing  so. 
737,geco,1-738,"John,  I  knew,  had  a  horror  of  any  kind  of  publicity,  and  was  an  easygoing  optimist,  who  preferred  never  to  meet  trouble  half-way. "
738,geco,1-739,It  might  be  difficult  to  convince  him  of  the  soundness  of  my  plan. 
739,geco,1-740,"Lawrence,  on  the  other  hand,  being  less  conventional,  and  having  more  imagination,  I  felt  I  might  count  upon  as  an  ally. "
740,geco,1-741,There  was  no  doubt  that  the  moment  had  come  for  me  to  take  the  lead. 
741,geco,1-742,"John,  I  said,  I  am  going  to  ask  you  something. "
742,geco,1-743,Well? 
743,geco,1-744,You  remember  my  speaking  of  my  friend  Poirot? 
744,geco,1-745,The  Belgian  who  is  here? 
745,geco,1-746,He  has  been  a  most  famous  detective. 
746,geco,1-747,Yes. 
747,geco,1-748,I  want  you  to  let  me  call  him  in...to  investigate  this  matter. 
748,geco,1-749,What...now? 
749,geco,1-750,Before  the  post-mortem? 
750,geco,1-751,"Yes,  time  is  an  advantage  if...if...there  has  been  foul  play. "
751,geco,1-752,Rubbish!  cried  Lawrence  angrily. 
752,geco,1-753,In  my  opinion  the  whole  thing  is  a  mare's  nest  of  Bauerstein's! 
753,geco,1-754,"Wilkins  hadn't  an  idea  of  such  a  thing,  until  Bauerstein  put  it  into  his  head. "
754,geco,1-755,"But,  like  all  specialists,  Bauerstein's  got  a  bee  in  his  bonnet. "
755,geco,1-756,"Poisons  are  his  hobby,  so  of  course  he  sees  them  everywhere. "
756,geco,1-757,I  confess  that  I  was  surprised  by  Lawrence's  attitude. 
757,geco,1-758,He  was  so  seldom  vehement  about  anything. 
758,geco,1-759,John  hesitated. 
759,geco,1-760,"I  can't  feel  as  you  do,  Lawrence,  he  said  at  last. "
760,geco,1-761,"I'm  inclined  to  give  Hastings  a  free  hand,  though  I  should  prefer  to  wait  a  bit. "
761,geco,1-762,We  don't  want  any  unnecessary  scandal. 
762,geco,1-763,"No,  no,  I  cried  eagerly,  you  need  have  no  fear  of  that. "
763,geco,1-764,Poirot  is  discretion  itself. 
764,geco,1-765,"Very  well,  then,  have  it  your  own  way. "
765,geco,1-766,I  leave  it  in  your  hands. 
766,geco,1-767,"Though,  if  it  is  as  we  suspect,  it  seems  a  clear  enough  case. "
767,geco,1-768,God  forgive  me  if  I  am  wronging  him! 
768,geco,1-769,I  looked  at  my  watch. 
769,geco,1-770,It  was  six  o'clock. 
770,geco,1-771,I  determined  to  lose  no  time. 
771,geco,1-772,"Five  minutes'  delay,  however,  I  allowed  myself. "
772,geco,1-773,I  spent  it  in  ransacking  the  library  until  I  discovered  a  medical  book  which  gave  a  description  of  strychnine  poisoning. 
773,geco,1-774,The  house  which  the  Belgians  occupied  in  the  village  was  quite  close  to  the  park  gates. 
774,geco,1-775,"One  could  save  time  by  taking  a  narrow  path  through  the  long  grass,  which  cut  off  the  detours  of  the  winding  drive. "
775,geco,1-776,"So  I,  accordingly,  went  that  way. "
776,geco,1-777,"I  had  nearly  reached  the  lodge,  when  my  attention  was  arrested  by  the  running  figure  of  a  man  approaching  me. "
777,geco,1-778,It  was  mr  Inglethorp. 
778,geco,1-779,Where  had  he  been? 
779,geco,1-780,How  did  he  intend  to  explain  his  absence? 
780,geco,1-781,He  accosted  me  eagerly. 
781,geco,1-782,My  God! 
782,geco,1-783,This  is  terrible! 
783,geco,1-784,My  poor  wife! 
784,geco,1-785,I  have  only  just  heard. 
785,geco,1-786,Where  have  you  been?  I  asked. 
786,geco,1-787,Denby  kept  me  late  last  night. 
787,geco,1-788,It  was  one  o'clock  before  we'd  finished. 
788,geco,1-789,Then  I  found  that  I'd  forgotten  the  latch-key  after  all. 
789,geco,1-790,"I  didn't  want  to  arouse  the  household,  so  Denby  gave  me  a  bed. "
790,geco,1-791,How  did  you  hear  the  news?  I  asked. 
791,geco,1-792,Wilkins  knocked  Denby  up  to  tell  him. 
792,geco,1-793,My  poor  Emily! 
793,geco,1-794,She  was  so  self-sacrificing...such  a  noble  character. 
794,geco,1-795,She  over-taxed  her  strength. 
795,geco,1-796,A  wave  of  revulsion  swept  over  me. 
796,geco,1-797,What  a  consummate  hypocrite  the  man  was! 
797,geco,1-798,"I  must  hurry  on,  I  said,  thankful  that  he  did  not  ask  me  whither  I  was  bound. "
798,geco,1-799,In  a  few  minutes  I  was  knocking  at  the  door  of  Leastways  Cottage. 
799,geco,1-800,"Getting  no  answer,  I  repeated  my  summons  impatiently. "
800,geco,1-801,"A  window  above  me  was  cautiously  opened,  and  Poirot  himself  looked  out. "
801,geco,1-802,He  gave  an  exclamation  of  surprise  at  seeing  me. 
802,geco,1-803,"In  a  few  brief  words,  I  explained  the  tragedy  that  had  occurred,  and  that  I  wanted  his  help. "
803,geco,1-804,"Wait,  my  friend,  I  will  let  you  in,  and  you  shall  recount  to  me  the  affair  whilst  I  dress. "
804,geco,1-805,"In  a  few  moments  he  had  unbarred  the  door,  and  I  followed  him  up  to  his  room. "
805,geco,1-806,"There  he  installed  me  in  a  chair,  and  I  related  the  whole  story,  keeping  back  nothing,  and  omitting  no  circumstance,  however  insignificant,  whilst  he  himself  made  a  careful  and  deliberate  toilet. "
806,geco,1-807,"I  told  him  of  my  awakening,  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  dying  words,  of  her  husband's  absence,  of  the  quarrel  the  day  before,  of  the  scrap  of  conversation  between  Mary  and  her  mother-in-law  that  I  had  overheard,  of  the  former  quarrel  between  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  and  Evelyn  Howard,  and  of  the  latter's  innuendoes. "
807,geco,1-808,I  was  hardly  as  clear  as  I  could  wish. 
808,geco,1-809,"I  repeated  myself  several  times,  and  occasionally  had  to  go  back  to  some  detail  that  I  had  forgotten. "
809,geco,1-810,Poirot  smiled  kindly  on  me. 
810,geco,1-811,The  mind  is  confused? 
811,geco,1-812,Is  it  not  so? 
812,geco,1-813,"Take  time,  mon  ami. "
813,geco,1-814,You  are  agitated;  you  are  excited...it  is  but  natural. 
814,geco,1-815,"Presently,  when  we  are  calmer,  we  will  arrange  the  facts,  neatly,  each  in  his  proper  place. "
815,geco,1-816,We  will  examine...and  reject. 
816,geco,1-817,"Those  of  importance  we  will  put  on  one  side;  those  of  no  importance,  pouf! ...he  screwed  up  his  cherub-like  face,  and  puffed  comically  enough... blow  them  away! "
817,geco,1-818,"That's  all  very  well,  I  objected,  but  how  are  you  going  to  decide  what  is  important,  and  what  isn't? "
818,geco,1-819,That  always  seems  the  difficulty  to  me. 
819,geco,1-820,Poirot  shook  his  head  energetically. 
820,geco,1-821,He  was  now  arranging  his  moustache  with  exquisite  care. 
821,geco,1-822,Not  so. 
822,geco,1-823,Voyons! 
823,geco,1-824,One  fact  leads  to  another...so  we  continue. 
824,geco,1-825,Does  the  next  fit  in  with  that? 
825,geco,1-826,A  merveille! 
826,geco,1-827,Good! 
827,geco,1-828,We  can  proceed. 
828,geco,1-829,This  next  little  fact...no! 
829,geco,1-830,"Ah,  that  is  curious! "
830,geco,1-831,There  is  something  missing...a  link  in  the  chain  that  is  not  there. 
831,geco,1-832,We  examine. 
832,geco,1-833,We  search. 
833,geco,1-834,"And  that  little  curious  fact,  that  possibly  paltry  little  detail  that  will  not  tally,  we  put  it  here! "
834,geco,1-835,He  made  an  extravagant  gesture  with  his  hand. 
835,geco,1-836,It  is  significant! 
836,geco,1-837,It  is  tremendous! 
837,geco,1-838,Y...es...  Ah! 
838,geco,1-839,Poirot  shook  his  forefinger  so  fiercely  at  me  that  I  quailed  before  it. 
839,geco,1-840,Beware! 
840,geco,1-841,Peril  to  the  detective  who  says:  'It  is  so  small...it  does  not  matter. 
841,geco,1-842,It  will  not  agree. 
842,geco,1-843,I  will  forget  it.' 
843,geco,1-844,That  way  lies  confusion! 
844,geco,1-845,Everything  matters. 
845,geco,1-846,I  know. 
846,geco,1-847,You  always  told  me  that. 
847,geco,1-848,That's  why  I  have  gone  into  all  the  details  of  this  thing  whether  they  seemed  to  me  relevant  or  not. 
848,geco,1-849,And  I  am  pleased  with  you. 
849,geco,1-850,"You  have  a  good  memory,  and  you  have  given  me  the  facts  faithfully. "
850,geco,1-851,"Of  the  order  in  which  you  present  them,  I  say  nothing...truly,  it  is  deplorable! "
851,geco,1-852,But  I  make  allowances...you  are  upset. 
852,geco,1-853,To  that  I  attribute  the  circumstance  that  you  have  omitted  one  fact  of  paramount  importance. 
853,geco,1-854,What  is  that?  I  asked. 
854,geco,1-855,You  have  not  told  me  if  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  ate  well  last  night. 
855,geco,1-856,I  stared  at  him. 
856,geco,1-857,Surely  the  war  had  affected  the  little  man's  brain. 
857,geco,1-858,"He  was  carefully  engaged  in  brushing  his  coat  before  putting  it  on,  and  seemed  wholly  engrossed  in  the  task. "
858,geco,1-859,"I  don't  remember,  I  said. "
859,geco,1-860,"And,  anyway,  I  don't  see...... "
860,geco,1-861,You do  not  see? 
861,geco,1-862,But  it  is  of  the  first  importance. 
862,geco,1-863,"I  can't  see  why,  I  said,  rather  nettled. "
863,geco,1-864,"As  far  as  I  can  remember,  she  didn't  eat  much. "
864,geco,1-865,"She  was  obviously  upset,  and  it  had  taken  her  appetite  away. "
865,geco,1-866,That  was  only  natural. 
866,geco,1-867,"Yes,  said  Poirot  thoughtfully,  it  was  only  natural. "
867,geco,1-868,"He  opened  a  drawer,  and  took  out  a  small  despatch-case,  then  turned  to  me. "
868,geco,1-869,Now  I  am  ready. 
869,geco,1-870,"We  will  proceed  to  the  chateau,  and  study  matters  on  the  spot. "
870,geco,1-871,"Excuse  me,  mon  ami,  you  dressed  in  haste,  and  your  tie  is  on  one  side. "
871,geco,1-872,Permit  me. 
872,geco,1-873,"With  a  deft  gesture,  he  rearranged  it. "
873,geco,1-874,Ca-y-est! 
874,geco,1-875,"Now,  shall  we  start? "
875,geco,1-876,"We  hurried  up  the  village,  and  turned  in  at  the  lodge  gates. "
876,geco,1-877,"Poirot  stopped  for  a  moment,  and  gazed  sorrowfully  over  the  beautiful  expanse  of  park,  still  glittering  with  morning  dew. "
877,geco,1-878,"So  beautiful,  so  beautiful,  and  yet,  the  poor  family,  plunged  in  sorrow,  prostrated  with  grief. "
878,geco,1-879,"He  looked  at  me  keenly  as  he  spoke,  and  I  was  aware  that  I  reddened  under  his  prolonged  gaze. "
879,geco,1-880,Was  the  family  prostrated  by  grief? 
880,geco,1-881,Was  the  sorrow  at  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  death  so  great? 
881,geco,1-882,I  realized  that  there  was  an  emotional  lack  in  the  atmosphere. 
882,geco,1-883,The  dead  woman  had  not  the  gift  of  commanding  love. 
883,geco,1-884,"Her  death  was  a  shock  and  a  distress,  but  she  would  not  be  passionately  regretted. "
884,geco,1-885,Poirot  seemed  to  follow  my  thoughts. 
885,geco,1-886,He  nodded  his  head  gravely. 
886,geco,1-887,"No,  you  are  right,  he  said,  it  is  not  as  though  there  was  a  blood  tie. "
887,geco,1-888,"She  has  been  kind  and  generous  to  these  Cavendishes,  but  she  was  not  their  own  mother. "
888,geco,1-889,Blood  tells...always  remember  that...blood  tells. 
889,geco,1-890,"Poirot,  I  said,  I  wish  you  would  tell  me  why  you  wanted  to  know  if  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  ate  well  last  night? "
890,geco,1-891,"I  have  been  turning  it  over  in  my  mind,  but  I  can't  see  how  it  has  anything  to  do  with  the  matter? "
891,geco,1-892,"He  was  silent  for  a  minute  or  two  as  we  walked  along,  but  finally  he  said:  I  do  not  mind  telling  you...though,  as  you  know,  it  is  not  my  habit  to  explain  until  the  end  is  reached. "
892,geco,1-893,"The  present  contention  is  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  died  of  strychnine  poisoning,  presumably  administered  in  her  coffee. "
893,geco,1-894,Yes? 
894,geco,1-895,"Well,  what  time  was  the  coffee  served? "
895,geco,1-896,About  eight  o'clock. 
896,geco,1-897,Therefore  she  drank  it  between  then  and  half-past  eight...certainly  not  much  later. 
897,geco,1-898,"Well,  strychnine  is  a  fairly  rapid  poison. "
898,geco,1-899,"Its  effects  would  be  felt  very  soon,  probably  in  about  an  hour. "
899,geco,1-900,"Yet,  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  case,  the  symptoms  do  not  manifest  themselves  until  five  o'clock  the  next  morning:  nine  hours! "
900,geco,1-901,"But  a  heavy  meal,  taken  at  about  the  same  time  as  the  poison,  might  retard  its  effects,  though  hardly  to  that  extent. "
901,geco,1-902,"Still,  it  is  a  possibility  to  be  taken  into  account. "
902,geco,1-903,"But,  according  to  you,  she  ate  very  little  for  supper,  and  yet  the  symptoms  do  not  develop  until  early  the  next  morning! "
903,geco,1-904,"Now  that  is  a  curious  circumstance,  my  friend. "
904,geco,1-905,Something  may  arise  at  the  autopsy  to  explain  it. 
905,geco,1-906,"In  the  meantime,  remember  it. "
906,geco,1-907,"As  we  neared  the  house,  John  came  out  and  met  us. "
907,geco,1-908,His  face  looked  weary  and  haggard. 
908,geco,1-909,"This  is  a  very  dreadful  business,  Monsieur  Poirot,  he  said. "
909,geco,1-910,Hastings  has  explained  to  you  that  we  are  anxious  for  no  publicity? 
910,geco,1-911,I  comprehend  perfectly. 
911,geco,1-912,"You  see,  it  is  only  suspicion  so  far. "
912,geco,1-913,We  have  nothing  to  go  upon. 
913,geco,1-914,Precisely. 
914,geco,1-915,It  is  a  matter  of  precaution  only. 
915,geco,1-916,"John  turned  to  me,  taking  out  his  cigarette-case,  and  lighting  a  cigarette  as  he  did  so. "
916,geco,1-917,You  know  that  fellow  Inglethorp  is  back? 
917,geco,1-918,Yes. 
918,geco,1-919,I  met  him. 
919,geco,1-920,"John  flung  the  match  into  an  adjacent  flower  bed,  a  proceeding  which  was  too  much  for  Poirot's  feelings. "
920,geco,1-921,"He  retrieved  it,  and  buried  it  neatly. "
921,geco,1-922,It's  jolly  difficult  to  know  how  to  treat  him. 
922,geco,1-923,"That  difficulty  will  not  exist  long,  pronounced  Poirot  quietly. "
923,geco,1-924,"John  looked  puzzled,  not  quite  understanding  the  portent  of  this  cryptic  saying. "
924,geco,1-925,He  handed  the  two  keys  which  Dr  Bauerstein  had  given  him  to  me. 
925,geco,1-926,Show  Monsieur  Poirot  everything  he  wants  to  see. 
926,geco,1-927,The  rooms  are  locked?  asked  Poirot. 
927,geco,1-928,Dr  Bauerstein  considered  it  advisable. 
928,geco,1-929,Poirot  nodded  thoughtfully. 
929,geco,1-930,Then  he  is  very  sure. 
930,geco,1-931,"Well,  that  simplifies  matters  for  us. "
931,geco,1-932,We  went  up  together  to  the  room  of  the  tragedy. 
932,geco,1-933,For  convenience  I  append  a  plan  of  the  room  and  the  principal  articles  of  furniture  in  it. 
933,geco,1-934,"Poirot  locked  the  door  on  the  inside,  and  proceeded  to  a  minute  inspection  of  the  room. "
934,geco,1-935,He  darted  from  one  object  to  the  other  with  the  agility  of  a  grasshopper. 
935,geco,1-936,"I  remained  by  the  door,  fearing  to  obliterate  any  clues. "
936,geco,1-937,"Poirot,  however,  did  not  seem  grateful  to  me  for  my  forbearance. "
937,geco,1-938,"What  have  you,  my  friend,  he  cried,  that  you  remain  there  like...how  do  you  say  it?...ah, "
938,geco,1-939,"yes,  the  stuck  pig? "
939,geco,1-940,I  explained  that  I  was  afraid  of  obliterating  any  foot-marks. 
940,geco,1-941,Foot-marks? 
941,geco,1-942,But  what  an  idea! 
942,geco,1-943,There  has  already  been  practically  an  army  in  the  room! 
943,geco,1-944,What  foot-marks  are  we  likely  to  find? 
944,geco,1-945,"No,  come  here  and  aid  me  in  my  search. "
945,geco,1-946,I  will  put  down  my  little  case  until  I  need  it. 
946,geco,1-947,"He  did  so,  on  the  round  table  by  the  window,  but  it  was  an  ill-advised  proceeding;  for,  the  top  of  it  being  loose,  it  tilted  up,  and  precipitated  the  despatch-case  on  the  floor. "
947,geco,1-948,Eh  voila  une  table!  cried  Poirot. 
948,geco,1-949,"Ah,  my  friend,  one  may  live  in  a  big  house  and  yet  have  no  comfort. "
949,geco,1-950,"After  which  piece  of  moralizing,  he  resumed  his  search. "
950,geco,1-951,"A  small  purple  despatch-case,  with  a  key  in  the  lock,  on  the  writing-table,  engaged  his  attention  for  some  time. "
951,geco,1-952,"He  took  out  the  key  from  the  lock,  and  passed  it  to  me  to  inspect. "
952,geco,1-953,"I  saw  nothing  peculiar,  however. "
953,geco,1-954,"It  was  an  ordinary  key  of  the  Yale  type,  with  a  bit  of  twisted  wire  through  the  handle. "
954,geco,1-955,"Next,  he  examined  the  framework  of  the  door  we  had  broken  in,  assuring  himself  that  the  bolt  had  really  been  shot. "
955,geco,1-956,Then  he  went  to  the  door  opposite  leading  into  Cynthia's  room. 
956,geco,1-957,"That  door  was  also  bolted,  as  I  had  stated. "
957,geco,1-958,"However,  he  went  to  the  length  of  unbolting  it,  and  opening  and  shutting  it  several  times;  this  he  did  with  the  utmost  precaution  against  making  any  noise. "
958,geco,1-959,Suddenly  something  in  the  bolt  itself  seemed  to  rivet  his  attention. 
959,geco,1-960,"He  examined  it  carefully,  and  then,  nimbly  whipping  out  a  pair  of  small  forceps  from  his  case,  he  drew  out  some  minute  particle  which  he  carefully  sealed  up  in  a  tiny  envelope. "
960,geco,1-961,On  the  chest  of  drawers  there  was  a  tray  with  a  spirit  lamp  and  a  small  saucepan  on  it. 
961,geco,1-962,"A  small  quantity  of  a  dark  fluid  remained  in  the  saucepan,  and  an  empty  cup  and  saucer  that  had  been  drunk  out  of  stood  near  it. "
962,geco,1-963,I  wondered  how  I  could  have  been  so  unobservant  as  to  overlook  this. 
963,geco,1-964,Here  was  a  clue  worth  having. 
964,geco,1-965,"Poirot  delicately  dipped  his  finger  into  liquid,  and  tasted  it  gingerly. "
965,geco,1-966,He  made  a  grimace. 
966,geco,1-967,cocoa...with...I  think...rum  in  it. 
967,geco,1-968,"He  passed  on  to  the  debris  on  the  floor,  where  the  table  by  the  bed  had  been  overturned. "
968,geco,1-969,"A  reading-lamp,  some  books,  matches,  a  bunch  of  keys,  and  the  crushed  fragments  of  a  coffee-cup  lay  scattered  about. "
969,geco,1-970,"Ah,  this  is  curious,  said  Poirot. "
970,geco,1-971,I  must  confess  that  I  see  nothing  particularly  curious  about  it. 
971,geco,1-972,You  do  not? 
972,geco,1-973,Observe  the  lamp...the  chimney  is  broken  in  two  places;  they  lie  there  as  they  fell. 
973,geco,1-974,"But  see,  the  coffee-cup  is  absolutely  smashed  to  powder. "
974,geco,1-975,"Well,  I  said  wearily,  I  suppose  some  one  must  have  stepped  on  it. "
975,geco,1-976,"Exactly,  said  Poirot,  in  an  odd  voice. "
976,geco,1-977,Some  one  stepped  on  it. 
977,geco,1-978,"He  rose  from  his  knees,  and  walked  slowly  across  to  the  mantelpiece,  where  he  stood  abstractedly  fingering  the  ornaments,  and  straightening  them...a  trick  of  his  when  he  was  agitated. "
978,geco,1-979,"Mon  ami,  he  said,  turning  to  me,  somebody  stepped  on  that  cup,  grinding  it  to  powder,  and  the  reason  they  did  so  was  either  because  it  contained  strychnine  or...which  is  far  more  serious...because  it  did  not  contain  strychnine! "
979,geco,1-980,I  made  no  reply. 
980,geco,1-981,"I  was  bewildered,  but  I  knew  that  it  was  no  good  asking  him  to  explain. "
981,geco,1-982,"In  a  moment  or  two  he  roused  himself,  and  went  on  with  his  investigations. "
982,geco,1-983,"He  picked  up  the  bunch  of  keys  from  the  floor,  and  twirling  them  round  in  his  fingers  finally  selected  one,  very  bright  and  shining,  which  he  tried  in  the  lock  of  the  purple  despatch-case. "
983,geco,1-984,"It  fitted,  and  he  opened  the  box,  but  after  a  moment's  hesitation,  closed  and  relocked  it,  and  slipped  the  bunch  of  keys,  as  well  as  the  key  that  had  originally  stood  in  the  lock,  into  his  own  pocket. "
984,geco,1-985,I  have  no  authority  to  go  through  these  papers. 
985,geco,1-986,But  it  should  be  done...at  once! 
986,geco,1-987,He  then  made  a  very  careful  examination  of  the  drawers  of  the  wash-stand. 
987,geco,1-988,"Crossing  the  room  to  the  left-hand  window,  a  round  stain,  hardly  visible  on  the  dark  brown  carpet,  seemed  to  interest  him  particularly. "
988,geco,1-989,"He  went  down  on  his  knees,  examining  it  minutely...even  going  so  far  as  to  smell  it. "
989,geco,1-990,"Finally,  he  poured  a  few  drops  of  the  cocoa  into  a  test  tube,  sealing  it  up  carefully. "
990,geco,1-991,His  next  proceeding  was  to  take  out  a  little  notebook. 
991,geco,1-992,"We  have  found  in  this  room,  he  said,  writing  busily,  six  points  of  interest. "
992,geco,1-993,"Shall  I  enumerate  them,  or  will  you? "
993,geco,1-994,"Oh,  you,  I  replied  hastily. "
994,geco,1-995,"Very  well,  then. "
995,geco,1-996,"One,  a  coffee-cup  that  has  been  ground  into  powder;  two,  a  despatch-case  with  a  key  in  the  lock;  three,  a  stain  on  the  floor. "
996,geco,1-997,"That  may  have  been  done  some  time  ago,  I  interrupted. "
997,geco,1-998,"No,  for  it  is  still  perceptibly  damp  and  smells  of  coffee. "
998,geco,1-999,"Four,  a  fragment  of  some  dark  green  fabric...only  a  thread  or  two,  but  recognizable. "
999,geco,1-1000,Ah!  I  cried. 
1000,geco,1-1001,That  was  what  you  sealed  up  in  the  envelope. 
1001,geco,1-1002,Yes. 
1002,geco,1-1003,"It  may  turn  out  to  be  a  piece  of  one  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  own  dresses,  and  quite  unimportant. "
1003,geco,1-1004,We  shall  see. 
1004,geco,1-1005,"Five,  ...this...! "
1005,geco,1-1006,"With  a  dramatic  gesture,  he  pointed  to  a  large  splash  of  candle  grease  on  the  floor  by  the  writing-table. "
1006,geco,1-1007,"It  must  have  been  done  since  yesterday,  otherwise  a  good  housemaid  would  have  at  once  removed  it  with  blotting-paper  and  a  hot  iron. "
1007,geco,1-1008,One  of  my  best  hats  once...but  that  is  not  to  the  point. 
1008,geco,1-1009,It  was  very  likely  done  last  night. 
1009,geco,1-1010,We  were  very  agitated. 
1010,geco,1-1011,Or  perhaps  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  herself  dropped  her  candle. 
1011,geco,1-1012,You  brought  only  one  candle  into  the  room? 
1012,geco,1-1013,Yes. 
1013,geco,1-1014,Lawrence  Cavendish  was  carrying  it. 
1014,geco,1-1015,But  he  was  very  upset. 
1015,geco,1-1016,He  seemed  to  see  something  over  here ...I  indicated  the  mantelpiece... that  absolutely  paralysed  him. 
1016,geco,1-1017,"That  is  interesting,  said  Poirot  quickly. "
1017,geco,1-1018,"Yes,  it  is  suggestive ...his  eye  sweeping  the  whole  length  of  the  wall... but  it  was  not  his  candle  that  made  this  great  patch,  for  you  perceive  that  this  is  white  grease;  whereas  Monsieur  Lawrence's  candle,  which  is  still  on  the  dressing-table,  is  pink. "
1018,geco,1-1019,"On  the  other  hand,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  no  candlestick  in  the  room,  only  a  reading-lamp. "
1019,geco,1-1020,"Then,  I  said,  what  do  you  deduce? "
1020,geco,1-1021,"To  which  my  friend  only  made  a  rather  irritating  reply,  urging  me  to  use  my  own  natural  faculties. "
1021,geco,1-1022,And  the  sixth  point?  I  asked. 
1022,geco,1-1023,I  suppose  it  is  the  sample  of  cocoa. 
1023,geco,1-1024,"No,  said  Poirot  thoughtfully. "
1024,geco,1-1025,"I  might  have  included  that  in  the  six,  but  I  did  not. "
1025,geco,1-1026,"No,  the  sixth  point  I  will  keep  to  myself  for  the  present. "
1026,geco,1-1027,He  looked  quickly  round  the  room. 
1027,geco,1-1028,"There  is  nothing  more  to  be  done  here,  I  think,  unless ...he  stared  earnestly  and  long  at  the  dead  ashes  in  the  grate. "
1028,geco,1-1029,The  fire  burns...and  it  destroys. 
1029,geco,1-1030,But  by  chance...there  might  be...let  us  see! 
1030,geco,1-1031,"Deftly,  on  hands  and  knees,  he  began  to  sort  the  ashes  from  the  grate  into  the  fender,  handling  them  with  the  greatest  caution. "
1031,geco,1-1032,"Suddenly,  he  gave  a  faint  exclamation. "
1032,geco,1-1033,"The  forceps,  Hastings! "
1033,geco,1-1034,"I  quickly  handed  them  to  him,  and  with  skill  he  extracted  a  small  piece  of  half  charred  paper. "
1034,geco,1-1035,"There,  mon  ami!  he  cried. "
1035,geco,1-1036,What  do  you  think  of  that? 
1036,geco,1-1037,I  scrutinized  the  fragment. 
1037,geco,1-1038,This  is  an  exact  reproduction  of  it:...  I  was  puzzled. 
1038,geco,1-1039,"It  was  unusually  thick,  quite  unlike  ordinary  notepaper. "
1039,geco,1-1040,Suddenly  an  idea  struck  me. 
1040,geco,1-1041,Poirot!  I  cried. 
1041,geco,1-1042,This  is  a  fragment  of  a  will! 
1042,geco,1-1043,Exactly. 
1043,geco,1-1044,I  looked  up  at  him  sharply. 
1044,geco,1-1045,You  are  not  surprised? 
1045,geco,1-1046,"No,  he  said  gravely,  I  expected  it. "
1046,geco,1-1047,"I  relinquished  the  piece  of  paper,  and  watched  him  put  it  away  in  his  case,  with  the  same  methodical  care  that  he  bestowed  on  everything. "
1047,geco,1-1048,My  brain  was  in  a  whirl. 
1048,geco,1-1049,What  was  this  complication  of  a  will? 
1049,geco,1-1050,Who  had  destroyed  it? 
1050,geco,1-1051,The  person  who  had  left  the  candle  grease  on  the  floor? 
1051,geco,1-1052,Obviously. 
1052,geco,1-1053,But  how  had  anyone  gained  admission? 
1053,geco,1-1054,All  the  doors  had  been  bolted  on  the  inside. 
1054,geco,1-1055,"Now,  my  friend,  said  Poirot  briskly,  we  will  go. "
1055,geco,1-1056,"I  should  like  to  ask  a  few  questions  of  the  parlourmaid...Dorcas,  her  name  is,  is  it  not? "
1056,geco,1-1057,"We  passed  through  Alfred  Inglethorp's  room,  and  Poirot  delayed  long  enough  to  make  a  brief  but  fairly  comprehensive  examination  of  it. "
1057,geco,1-1058,"We  went  out  through  that  door,  locking  both  it  and  that  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room  as  before. "
1058,geco,1-1059,"I  took  him  down  to  the  boudoir  which  he  had  expressed  a  wish  to  see,  and  went  myself  in  search  of  Dorcas. "
1059,geco,1-1060,"When  I  returned  with  her,  however,  the  boudoir  was  empty. "
1060,geco,1-1061,"Poirot,  I  cried,  where  are  you? "
1061,geco,1-1062,"I  am  here,  my  friend. "
1062,geco,1-1063,"He  had  stepped  outside  the  French  window,  and  was  standing,  apparently  lost  in  admiration,  before  the  various  shaped  flower  beds. "
1063,geco,1-1064,Admirable! 
1064,geco,1-1065,he  murmured. 
1065,geco,1-1066,Admirable! 
1066,geco,1-1067,What  symmetry! 
1067,geco,1-1068,Observe  that  crescent;  and  those  diamonds...their  neatness  rejoices  the  eye. 
1068,geco,1-1069,"The  spacing  of  the  plants,  also,  is  perfect. "
1069,geco,1-1070,It  has  been  recently  done;  is  it  not  so? 
1070,geco,1-1071,"Yes,  I  believe  they  were  at  it  yesterday  afternoon. "
1071,geco,1-1072,But  come  in...Dorcas  is  here. 
1072,geco,1-1073,"Eh  bien,  eh  bien! "
1073,geco,1-1074,Do  not  grudge  me  a  moment's  satisfaction  of  the  eye. 
1074,geco,1-1075,"Yes,  but  this  affair  is  more  important. "
1075,geco,1-1076,And  how  do  you  know  that  these  fine  begonias  are  not  of  equal  importance? 
1076,geco,1-1077,I  shrugged  my  shoulders. 
1077,geco,1-1078,There  was  really  no  arguing  with  him  if  he  chose  to  take  that  line. 
1078,geco,1-1079,You  do  not  agree? 
1079,geco,1-1080,But  such  things  have  been. 
1080,geco,1-1081,"Well,  we  will  come  in  and  interview  the  brave  Dorcas. "
1081,geco,1-1082,"Dorcas  was  standing  in  the  boudoir,  her  hands  folded  in  front  of  her,  and  her  grey  hair  rose  in  stiff  waves  under  her  white  cap. "
1082,geco,1-1083,She  was  the  very  model  and  picture  of  a  good  old-fashioned  servant. 
1083,geco,1-1084,"In  her  attitude  towards  Poirot,  she  was  inclined  to  be  suspicious,  but  he  soon  broke  down  her  defences. "
1084,geco,1-1085,He  drew  forward  a  chair. 
1085,geco,1-1086,"Pray  be  seated,  mademoiselle. "
1086,geco,1-1087,"Thank  you,  sir. "
1087,geco,1-1088,"You  have  been  with  your  mistress  many  years,  is  it  not  so? "
1088,geco,1-1089,"Ten  years,  sir. "
1089,geco,1-1090,"That  is  a  long  time,  and  very  faithful  service. "
1090,geco,1-1091,"You  were  much  attached  to  her,  were  you  not? "
1091,geco,1-1092,"She  was  a  very  good  mistress  to  me,  sir. "
1092,geco,1-1093,Then  you  will  not  object  to  answering  a  few  questions. 
1093,geco,1-1094,I  put  them  to  you  with  mr  Cavendish's  full  approval. 
1094,geco,1-1095,"Oh,  certainly,  sir. "
1095,geco,1-1096,Then  I  will  begin  by  asking  you  about  the  events  of  yesterday  afternoon. 
1096,geco,1-1097,Your  mistress  had  a  quarrel? 
1097,geco,1-1098,"Yes,  sir. "
1098,geco,1-1099,But  I  don't  know  that  I  ought......  Dorcas  hesitated. 
1099,geco,1-1100,Poirot  looked  at  her  keenly. 
1100,geco,1-1101,"My  good  Dorcas,  it  is  necessary  that  I  should  know  every  detail  of  that  quarrel  as  fully  as  possible. "
1101,geco,1-1102,Do  not  think  that  you  are  betraying  your  mistress's  secrets. 
1102,geco,1-1103,"Your  mistress  lies  dead,  and  it  is  necessary  that  we  should  know  all...if  we  are  to  avenge  her. "
1103,geco,1-1104,"Nothing  can  bring  her  back  to  life,  but  we  do  hope,  if  there  has  been  foul  play,  to  bring  the  murderer  to  justice. "
1104,geco,1-1105,"Amen  to  that,  said  Dorcas  fiercely. "
1105,geco,1-1106,"And,  naming  no  names,  there's  one  in  this  house  that  none  of  us  could  ever  abide! "
1106,geco,1-1107,And  an  ill  day  it  was  when  first  'he'  darkened  the  threshold. 
1107,geco,1-1108,"Poirot  waited  for  her  indignation  to  subside,  and  then,  resuming  his  business-like  tone,  he  asked:  Now,  as  to  this  quarrel? "
1108,geco,1-1109,What  is  the  first  you  heard  of  it? 
1109,geco,1-1110,"Well,  sir,  I  happened  to  be  going  along  the  hall  outside  yesterday...... "
1110,geco,1-1111,What time  was  that? 
1111,geco,1-1112,"I  couldn't  say  exactly,  sir,  but  it  wasn't  tea-time  by  a  long  way. "
1112,geco,1-1113,Perhaps  four  o'clock...or  it  may  have  been  a  bit  later. 
1113,geco,1-1114,"Well,  sir,  as  I  said,  I  happened  to  be  passing  along,  when  I  heard  voices  very  loud  and  angry  in  here. "
1114,geco,1-1115,"I  didn't  exactly  mean  to  listen,  but...well,  there  it  is. "
1115,geco,1-1116,I  stopped. 
1116,geco,1-1117,"The  door  was  shut,  but  the  mistress  was  speaking  very  sharp  and  clear,  and  I  heard  what  she  said  quite  plainly. "
1117,geco,1-1118,"'You  have  lied  to  me,  and  deceived  me,'  she  said. "
1118,geco,1-1119,I  didn't  hear  what  mr  Inglethorp  replied. 
1119,geco,1-1120,He  spoke  a  good  bit  lower  than  she  did...but  she  answered:  'How  dare  you? 
1120,geco,1-1121,I  have  kept  you  and  clothed  you  and  fed  you! 
1121,geco,1-1122,You  owe  everything  to  me! 
1122,geco,1-1123,And  this  is  how  you  repay  me! 
1123,geco,1-1124,By  bringing  disgrace  upon  our  name!' 
1124,geco,1-1125,"Again  I  didn't  hear  what  he  said,  but  she  went  on:  'Nothing  that  you  can  say  will  make  any  difference. "
1125,geco,1-1126,I  see  my  duty  clearly. 
1126,geco,1-1127,My  mind  is  made  up. 
1127,geco,1-1128,"You  need  not  think  that  any  fear  of  publicity,  or  scandal  between  husband  and  wife  will  deter  me.' "
1128,geco,1-1129,"Then  I  thought  I  heard  them  coming  out,  so  I  went  off  quickly. "
1129,geco,1-1130,You  are  sure  it  was  mr  Inglethorp's  voice  you  heard? 
1130,geco,1-1131,"Oh,  yes,  sir,  whose  else's  could  it  be? "
1131,geco,1-1132,"Well,  what  happened  next? "
1132,geco,1-1133,"Later,  I  came  back  to  the  hall;  but  it  was  all  quiet. "
1133,geco,1-1134,"At  five  o'clock,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  rang  the  bell  and  told  me  to  bring  her  a  cup  of  tea...nothing  to  eat...to  the  boudoir. "
1134,geco,1-1135,She  was  looking  dreadful...so  white  and  upset. 
1135,geco,1-1136,"'Dorcas,'  she  says,  'I've  had  a  great  shock.' "
1136,geco,1-1137,"'I'm  sorry  for  that,  m'm,'  I  says. "
1137,geco,1-1138,"'You'll  feel  better  after  a  nice  hot  cup  of  tea,  m'm.' "
1138,geco,1-1139,She  had  something  in  her  hand. 
1139,geco,1-1140,"I  don't  know  if  it  was  a  letter,  or  just  a  piece  of  paper,  but  it  had  writing  on  it,  and  she  kept  staring  at  it,  almost  as  if  she  couldn't  believe  what  was  written  there. "
1140,geco,1-1141,"She  whispered  to  herself,  as  though  she  had  forgotten  I  was  there:  'These  few  words...and  everything's  changed.' "
1141,geco,1-1142,"And  then  she  says  to  me:  'Never  trust  a  man,  Dorcas,  they're  not  worth  it!' "
1142,geco,1-1143,"I  hurried  off,  and  got  her  a  good  strong  cup  of  tea,  and  she  thanked  me,  and  said  she'd  feel  better  when  she'd  drunk  it. "
1143,geco,1-1144,"'I  don't  know  what  to  do,'  she  says. "
1144,geco,1-1145,"'Scandal  between  husband  and  wife  is  a  dreadful  thing,  Dorcas. "
1145,geco,1-1146,I'd  rather  hush  it  up  if  I  could.' 
1146,geco,1-1147,"Mr.s.  Cavendish  came  in  just  then,  so  she  didn't  say  any  more. "
1147,geco,1-1148,"She  still  had  the  letter,  or  whatever  it  was,  in  her  hand? "
1148,geco,1-1149,"Yes,  sir. "
1149,geco,1-1150,What  would  she  be  likely  to  do  with  it  afterwards? 
1150,geco,1-1151,"Well,  I  don't  know,  sir,  I  expect  she  would  lock  it  up  in  that  purple  case  of  hers. "
1151,geco,1-1152,Is  that  where  she  usually  kept  important  papers? 
1152,geco,1-1153,"Yes,  sir. "
1153,geco,1-1154,"She  brought  it  down  with  her  every  morning,  and  took  it  up  every  night. "
1154,geco,1-1155,When  did  she  lose  the  key  of  it? 
1155,geco,1-1156,"She  missed  it  yesterday  at  lunch-time,  sir,  and  told  me  to  look  carefully  for  it. "
1156,geco,1-1157,She  was  very  much  put  out  about  it. 
1157,geco,1-1158,But  she  had  a  duplicate  key? 
1158,geco,1-1159,"Oh,  yes,  sir. "
1159,geco,1-1160,"Dorcas  was  looking  very  curiously  at  him  and,  to  tell  the  truth,  so  was  I. "
1160,geco,1-1161,What  was  all  this  about  a  lost  key? 
1161,geco,1-1162,Poirot  smiled. 
1162,geco,1-1163,"Never  mind,  Dorcas,  it  is  my  business  to  know  things. "
1163,geco,1-1164,Is  this  the  key  that  was  lost? 
1164,geco,1-1165,He  drew  from  his  pocket  the  key  that  he  had  found  in  the  lock  of  the  despatch-case  upstairs. 
1165,geco,1-1166,Dorcas's  eyes  looked  as  though  they  would  pop  out  of  her  head. 
1166,geco,1-1167,"That's  it,  sir,  right  enough. "
1167,geco,1-1168,But  where  did  you  find  it? 
1168,geco,1-1169,I  looked  everywhere  for  it. 
1169,geco,1-1170,"Ah,  but  you  see  it  was  not  in  the  same  place  yesterday  as  it  was  today. "
1170,geco,1-1171,"Now,  to  pass  to  another  subject,  had  your  mistress  a  dark  green  dress  in  her  wardrobe? "
1171,geco,1-1172,Dorcas  was  rather  startled  by  the  unexpected  question. 
1172,geco,1-1173,"No,  sir. "
1173,geco,1-1174,Are  you  quite  sure? 
1174,geco,1-1175,"Oh,  yes,  sir. "
1175,geco,1-1176,Has  anyone  else  in  the  house  got  a  green  dress? 
1176,geco,1-1177,Dorcas  reflected. 
1177,geco,1-1178,Miss  Cynthia  has  a  green  evening  dress. 
1178,geco,1-1179,Light  or  dark  green? 
1179,geco,1-1180,"A  light  green,  sir;  a  sort  of  chiffon,  they  call  it. "
1180,geco,1-1181,"Ah,  that  is  not  what  I  want. "
1181,geco,1-1182,And  nobody  else  has  anything  green? 
1182,geco,1-1183,"No,  sir...not  that  I  know  of. "
1183,geco,1-1184,Poirot's  face  did  not  betray  a  trace  of  whether  he  was  disappointed  or  otherwise. 
1184,geco,1-1185,"He  merely  remarked:  Good,  we  will  leave  that  and  pass  on. "
1185,geco,1-1186,Have  you  any  reason  to  believe  that  your  mistress  was  likely  to  take  a  sleeping  powder  last  night? 
1186,geco,1-1187,"Not  last  night,  sir,  I  know  she  didn't. "
1187,geco,1-1188,Why  do  you  know  so  positively? 
1188,geco,1-1189,Because  the  box  was  empty. 
1189,geco,1-1190,"She  took  the  last  one  two  days  ago,  and  she  didn't  have  any  more  made  up. "
1190,geco,1-1191,You  are  quite  sure  of  that? 
1191,geco,1-1192,"Positive,  sir. "
1192,geco,1-1193,Then  that  is  cleared  up! 
1193,geco,1-1194,"By  the  way,  your  mistress  didn't  ask  you  to  sign  any  paper  yesterday? "
1194,geco,1-1195,To  sign  a  paper? 
1195,geco,1-1196,"No,  sir. "
1196,geco,1-1197,"When  mr  Hastings  and  mr  Lawrence  came  in  yesterday  evening,  they  found  your  mistress  busy  writing  letters. "
1197,geco,1-1198,I  suppose  you  can  give  me  no  idea  to  whom  these  letters  were  addressed? 
1198,geco,1-1199,"I'm  afraid  I  couldn't,  sir. "
1199,geco,1-1200,I  was  out  in  the  evening. 
1200,geco,1-1201,"Perhaps  Annie  could  tell  you,  though  she's  a  careless  girl. "
1201,geco,1-1202,Never  cleared  the  coffee-cups  away  last  night. 
1202,geco,1-1203,That's  what  happens  when  I'm  not  here  to  look  after  things. 
1203,geco,1-1204,Poirot  lifted  his  hand. 
1204,geco,1-1205,"Since  they  have  been  left,  Dorcas,  leave  them  a  little  longer,  I  pray  you. "
1205,geco,1-1206,I  should  like  to  examine  them. 
1206,geco,1-1207,"Very  well,  sir. "
1207,geco,1-1208,What  time  did  you  go  out  last  evening? 
1208,geco,1-1209,"About  six  o'clock,  sir. "
1209,geco,1-1210,"Thank  you,  Dorcas,  that  is  all  I  have  to  ask  you. "
1210,geco,1-1211,He  rose  and  strolled  to  the  window. 
1211,geco,1-1212,I  have  been  admiring  these  flower  beds. 
1212,geco,1-1213,"How  many  gardeners  are  employed  here,  by  the  way? "
1213,geco,1-1214,"Only  three  now,  sir. "
1214,geco,1-1215,"Five,  we  had,  before  the  war,  when  it  was  kept  as  a  gentleman's  place  should  be. "
1215,geco,1-1216,"I  wish  you  could  have  seen  it  then,  sir. "
1216,geco,1-1217,A  fair  sight  it  was. 
1217,geco,1-1218,"But  now  there's  only  old  Manning,  and  young  William,  and  a  new-fashioned  woman  gardener  in  breeches  and  such-like. "
1218,geco,1-1219,"Ah,  these  are  dreadful  times! "
1219,geco,1-1220,"The  good  times  will  come  again,  Dorcas. "
1220,geco,1-1221,"At  least,  we  hope  so. "
1221,geco,1-1222,"Now,  will  you  send  Annie  to  me  here? "
1222,geco,1-1223,"Yes,  sir. "
1223,geco,1-1224,"Thank  you,  sir. "
1224,geco,1-1225,"How  did  you  know  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  took  sleeping  powders?  I  asked,  in  lively  curiosity,  as  Dorcas  left  the  room. "
1225,geco,1-1226,And  about  the  lost  key  and  the  duplicate? 
1226,geco,1-1227,One  thing  at  a  time. 
1227,geco,1-1228,"As  to  the  sleeping  powders,  I  knew  by  this. "
1228,geco,1-1229,"He  suddenly  produced  a  small  cardboard  box,  such  as  chemists  use  for  powders. "
1229,geco,1-1230,Where  did  you  find  it? 
1230,geco,1-1231,In  the  wash-stand  drawer  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  bedroom. 
1231,geco,1-1232,It  was  Number  Six  of  my  catalogue. 
1232,geco,1-1233,"But  I  suppose,  as  the  last  powder  was  taken  two  days  ago,  it  is  not  of  much  importance? "
1233,geco,1-1234,"Probably  not,  but  do  you  notice  anything  that  strikes  you  as  peculiar  about  this  box? "
1234,geco,1-1235,I  examined  it  closely. 
1235,geco,1-1236,"No,  I  can't  say  that  I  do. "
1236,geco,1-1237,Look  at  the  label. 
1237,geco,1-1238,"I  read  the  label  carefully:  'One  powder  to  be  taken  at  bedtime,  if  required. "
1238,geco,1-1239,Mr.s.  Inglethorp.' 
1239,geco,1-1240,"No,  I  see  nothing  unusual. "
1240,geco,1-1241,Not  the  fact  that  there  is  no  chemist's  name? 
1241,geco,1-1242,Ah! 
1242,geco,1-1243,I  exclaimed. 
1243,geco,1-1244,"To  be  sure,  that  is  odd! "
1244,geco,1-1245,"Have  you  ever  known  a  chemist  to  send  out  a  box  like  that,  without  his  printed  name? "
1245,geco,1-1246,"No,  I  can't  say  that  I  have. "
1246,geco,1-1247,"I  was  becoming  quite  excited,  but  Poirot  damped  my  ardour  by  remarking:  Yet  the  explanation  is  quite  simple.So "
1247,geco,1-1248,"do  not  intrigue  yourself,  my  friend. "
1248,geco,1-1249,"An  audible  creaking  proclaimed  the  approach  of  Annie,  so  I  had  no  time  to  reply. "
1249,geco,1-1250,"Annie  was  a  fine,  strapping  girl,  and  was  evidently  labouring  under  intense  excitement,  mingled  with  a  certain  ghoulish  enjoyment  of  the  tragedy. "
1250,geco,1-1251,"Poirot  came  to  the  point  at  once,  with  a  business-like  briskness. "
1251,geco,1-1252,"I  sent  for  you,  Annie,  because  I  thought  you  might  be  able  to  tell  me  something  about  the  letters  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  wrote  last  night. "
1252,geco,1-1253,How  many  were  there? 
1253,geco,1-1254,And  can  you  tell  me  any  of  the  names  and  addresses? 
1254,geco,1-1255,Annie  considered. 
1255,geco,1-1256,"There  were  four  letters,  sir. "
1256,geco,1-1257,"One  was  to  Miss  Howard,  and  one  was  to  mr  Wells,  the  lawyer,  and  the  other  two  I  don't  think  I  remember,  sir...oh,  yes,  one  was  to  Ross's,  the  caterers  in  Tadminster. "
1257,geco,1-1258,"The  other  one,  I  don't  remember. "
1258,geco,1-1259,"Think,  urged  Poirot. "
1259,geco,1-1260,Annie  racked  her  brains  in  vain. 
1260,geco,1-1261,"I'm  sorry,  sir,  but  it's  clean  gone. "
1261,geco,1-1262,I  don't  think  I  can  have  noticed  it. 
1262,geco,1-1263,"It  does  not  matter,  said  Poirot,  not  betraying  any  sign  of  disappointment. "
1263,geco,1-1264,Now  I  want  to  ask  you  about  something  else. 
1264,geco,1-1265,There  is  a  saucepan  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room  with  some  cocoa  in  it. 
1265,geco,1-1266,Did  she  have  that  every  night? 
1266,geco,1-1267,"Yes,  sir,  it  was  put  in  her  room  every  evening,  and  she  warmed  it  up  in  the  night...whenever  she  fancied  it. "
1267,geco,1-1268,What  was  it? 
1268,geco,1-1269,Plain  cocoa? 
1269,geco,1-1270,"Yes,  sir,  made  with  milk,  with  a  teaspoonful  of  sugar,  and  two  teaspoonfuls  of  rum  in  it. "
1270,geco,1-1271,Who  took  it  to  her  room? 
1271,geco,1-1272,"I  did,  sir. "
1272,geco,1-1273,Always? 
1273,geco,1-1274,"Yes,  sir. "
1274,geco,1-1275,At  what  time? 
1275,geco,1-1276,"When  I  went  to  draw  the  curtains,  as  a  rule,  sir. "
1276,geco,1-1277,Did  you  bring  it  straight  up  from  the  kitchen  then? 
1277,geco,1-1278,"No,  sir,  you  see  there's  not  much  room  on  the  gas  stove,  so  Cook  used  to  make  it  early,  before  putting  the  vegetables  on  for  supper. "
1278,geco,1-1279,"Then  I  used  to  bring  it  up,  and  put  it  on  the  table  by  the  swing  door,  and  take  it  into  her  room  later. "
1279,geco,1-1280,"The  swing  door  is  in  the  left  wing,  is  it  not? "
1280,geco,1-1281,"Yes,  sir. "
1281,geco,1-1282,"And  the  table,  is  it  on  this  side  of  the  door,  or  on  the  farther...servants'  side? "
1282,geco,1-1283,"It's  this  side,  sir. "
1283,geco,1-1284,What  time  did  you  bring  it  up  last  night? 
1284,geco,1-1285,"About  quarter-past  seven,  I  should  say,  sir. "
1285,geco,1-1286,And  when  did  you  take  it  into  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room? 
1286,geco,1-1287,"When  I  went  to  shut  up,  sir. "
1287,geco,1-1288,About  eight  o'clock. 
1288,geco,1-1289,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  came  up  to  bed  before  I'd  finished. 
1289,geco,1-1290,"Then,  between  7.15 "
1290,geco,1-1291,"and  8 o'clock,  the  cocoa  was  standing  on  the  table  in  the  left  wing? "
1291,geco,1-1292,"Yes,  sir. "
1292,geco,1-1293,"Annie  had  been  growing  redder  and  redder  in  the  face,  and  now  she  blurted  out  unexpectedly:  And  if  there  was  salt  in  it,  sir,  it  wasn't  me. "
1293,geco,1-1294,I  never  took  the  salt  near  it. 
1294,geco,1-1295,What  makes  you  think  there  was  salt  in  it?  asked  Poirot. 
1295,geco,1-1296,"Seeing  it  on  the  tray,  sir. "
1296,geco,1-1297,You  saw  some  salt  on  the  tray? 
1297,geco,1-1298,Yes. 
1298,geco,1-1299,"Coarse  kitchen  salt,  it  looked. "
1299,geco,1-1300,"I  never  noticed  it  when  I  took  the  tray  up,  but  when  I  came  to  take  it  into  the  mistress's  room  I  saw  it  at  once,  and  I  suppose  I  ought  to  have  taken  it  down  again,  and  asked  Cook  to  make  some  fresh. "
1300,geco,1-1301,"But  I  was  in  a  hurry,  because  Dorcas  was  out,  and  I  thought  maybe  the  cocoa  itself  was  all  right,  and  the  salt  had  only  gone  on  the  tray. "
1301,geco,1-1302,"So  I  dusted  it  off  with  my  apron,  and  took  it  in. "
1302,geco,1-1303,I  had  the  utmost  difficulty  in  controlling  my  excitement. 
1303,geco,1-1304,"Unknown  to  herself,  Annie  had  provided  us  with  an  important  piece  of  evidence. "
1304,geco,1-1305,"How  she  would  have  gaped  if  she  had  realized  that  her  coarse  kitchen  salt  was  strychnine,  one  of  the  most  deadly  poisons  known  to  mankind. "
1305,geco,1-1306,I  marvelled  at  Poirot's  calm. 
1306,geco,1-1307,His  self-control  was  astonishing. 
1307,geco,1-1308,"I  awaited  his  next  question  with  impatience,  but  it  disappointed  me. "
1308,geco,1-1309,"When  you  went  into  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room,  was  the  door  leading  into  Miss  Cynthia's  room  bolted? "
1309,geco,1-1310,Oh! 
1310,geco,1-1311,"Yes,  sir;  it  always  was. "
1311,geco,1-1312,It  had  never  been  opened. 
1312,geco,1-1313,And  the  door  into  mr  Inglethorp's  room? 
1313,geco,1-1314,Did  you  notice  if  that  was  bolted  too? 
1314,geco,1-1315,Annie  hesitated. 
1315,geco,1-1316,"I  couldn't  rightly  say,  sir;  it  was  shut  but  I  couldn't  say  whether  it  was  bolted  or  not. "
1316,geco,1-1317,"When  you  finally  left  the  room,  did  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  bolt  the  door  after  you? "
1317,geco,1-1318,"No,  sir,  not  then,  but  I  expect  she  did  later. "
1318,geco,1-1319,She  usually  did  lock  it  at  night. 
1319,geco,1-1320,"The  door  into  the  passage,  that  is. "
1320,geco,1-1321,Did  you  notice  any  candle  grease  on  the  floor  when  you  did  the  room  yesterday? 
1321,geco,1-1322,Candle  grease? 
1322,geco,1-1323,"Oh,  no,  sir. "
1323,geco,1-1324,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  didn't  have  a  candle,  only  a  reading-lamp. "
1324,geco,1-1325,"Then,  if  there  had  been  a  large  patch  of  candle  grease  on  the  floor,  you  think  you  would  have  been  sure  to  have  seen  it? "
1325,geco,1-1326,"Yes,  sir,  and  I  would  have  taken  it  out  with  a  piece  of  blotting-paper  and  a  hot  iron. "
1326,geco,1-1327,Then  Poirot  repeated  the  question  he  had  put  to  Dorcas:  Did  your  mistress  ever  have  a  green  dress? 
1327,geco,1-1328,"No,  sir. "
1328,geco,1-1329,"Nor  a  mantle,  nor  a  cape,  nor  a...how  do  you  call  it?...a "
1329,geco,1-1330,sports  coat? 
1330,geco,1-1331,"Not  green,  sir. "
1331,geco,1-1332,Nor  anyone  else  in  the  house? 
1332,geco,1-1333,Annie  reflected. 
1333,geco,1-1334,"No,  sir. "
1334,geco,1-1335,You  are  sure  of  that? 
1335,geco,1-1336,Quite  sure. 
1336,geco,1-1337,Bien! 
1337,geco,1-1338,That  is  all  I  want  to  know. 
1338,geco,1-1339,Thank  you  very  much. 
1339,geco,1-1340,"With  a  nervous  giggle,  Annie  took  herself  creakingly  out  of  the  room. "
1340,geco,1-1341,My  pent-up  excitement  burst  forth. 
1341,geco,1-1342,"Poirot,  I  cried,  I  congratulate  you! "
1342,geco,1-1343,This  is  a  great  discovery. 
1343,geco,1-1344,What  is  a  great  discovery? 
1344,geco,1-1345,"Why,  that  it  was  the  cocoa  and  not  the  coffee  that  was  poisoned. "
1345,geco,1-1346,That  explains  everything! 
1346,geco,1-1347,"Of  course  it  did  not  take  effect  until  the  early  morning,  since  the  cocoa  was  only  drunk  in  the  middle  of  the  night. "
1347,geco,1-1348,"So  you  think  that  the  cocoa...mark  well  what  I  say,  Hastings,  the  cocoa...contained  strychnine? "
1348,geco,1-1349,Of  course! 
1349,geco,1-1350,"That  salt  on  the  tray,  what  else  could  it  have  been? "
1350,geco,1-1351,"It  might  have  been  salt,  replied  Poirot  placidly. "
1351,geco,1-1352,I  shrugged  my  shoulders. 
1352,geco,1-1353,"If  he  was  going  to  take  the  matter  that  way,  it  was  no  good  arguing  with  him. "
1353,geco,1-1354,"The  idea  crossed  my  mind,  not  for  the  first  time,  that  poor  old  Poirot  was  growing  old. "
1354,geco,1-1355,Privately  I  thought  it  lucky  that  he  had  associated  with  him  some  one  of  a  more  receptive  type  of  mind. 
1355,geco,1-1356,Poirot  was  surveying  me  with  quietly  twinkling  eyes. 
1356,geco,1-1357,"You  are  not  pleased  with  me,  mon  ami? "
1357,geco,1-1358,"My  dear  Poirot,  I  said  coldly,  it  is  not  for  me  to  dictate  to  you. "
1358,geco,1-1359,"You  have  a  right  to  your  own  opinion,  just  as  I  have  to  mine. "
1359,geco,1-1360,"A  most  admirable  sentiment,  remarked  Poirot,  rising  briskly  to  his  feet. "
1360,geco,1-1361,Now  I  have  finished  with  this  room. 
1361,geco,1-1362,"By  the  way,  whose  is  the  smaller  desk  in  the  corner? "
1362,geco,1-1363,mr  Inglethorp's. 
1363,geco,1-1364,Ah! 
1364,geco,1-1365,He  tried  the  roll  top  tentatively. 
1365,geco,1-1366,Locked. 
1366,geco,1-1367,But  perhaps  one  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  keys  would  open  it. 
1367,geco,1-1368,"He  tried  several,  twisting  and  turning  them  with  a  practiced  hand,  and  finally  uttering  an  ejaculation  of  satisfaction. "
1368,geco,1-1369,Voila! 
1369,geco,1-1370,"It  is  not  the  key,  but  it  will  open  it  at  a  pinch. "
1370,geco,1-1371,"He  slid  back  the  roll  top,  and  ran  a  rapid  eye  over  the  neatly  filed  papers. "
1371,geco,1-1372,"To  my  surprise,  he  did  not  examine  them,  merely  remarking  approvingly  as  he  relocked  the  desk:  Decidedly,  he  is  a  man  of  method,  this  mr  Inglethorp! "
1372,geco,1-1373,"A  'man  of  method'  was,  in  Poirot's  estimation,  the  highest  praise  that  could  be  bestowed  on  any  individual. "
1373,geco,1-1374,"I  felt  that  my  friend  was  not  what  he  had  been  as  he  rambled  on  disconnectedly:  There  were  no  stamps  in  his  desk,  but  there  might  have  been,  eh,  mon  ami? "
1374,geco,1-1375,Yes ...his  eyes  wandered  round  the  room... this  boudoir  has  nothing  more  to  tell  us. 
1375,geco,1-1376,It  did  not  yield  much. 
1376,geco,1-1377,Only  this. 
1377,geco,1-1378,"He  pulled  a  crumpled  envelope  out  of  his  pocket,  and  tossed  it  over  to  me. "
1378,geco,1-1379,It  was  rather  a  curious  document. 
1379,geco,1-1380,"A  plain,  dirty  looking  old  envelope  with  a  few  words  scrawled  across  it,  apparently  at  random. "
1380,geco,1-1381,The  following  is  a  facsimile  of  it. 
1381,geco,2-1,"Where did you  find  this?  I  asked  Poirot,  in  lively  curiosity. "
1382,geco,2-2,In  the  waste-paper  waste-paper  basket. 
1383,geco,2-3,You  recognise  the  handwriting? 
1384,geco,2-4,"Yes,  it  is  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's. "
1385,geco,2-5,But  what  does  it  mean? 
1386,geco,2-6,Poirot  shrugged  his  shoulders. 
1387,geco,2-7,I  cannot  say...but  it  is  suggestive. 
1388,geco,2-8,A  wild  idea  flashed  across  me. 
1389,geco,2-9,Was  it  possible  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  mind  was  deranged? 
1390,geco,2-10,Had  she  some  fantastic  idea  of  demoniacal  possession? 
1391,geco,2-11,"And,  if  that  were  so,  was  it  not  also  possible  that  she  might  have  taken  her  own  life? "
1392,geco,2-12,"I  was  about  to  expound  these  theories  to  Poirot,  when  his  own  words  distracted  me. "
1393,geco,2-13,"Come,  he  said,  now  to  examine  the  coffee-cups! "
1394,geco,2-14,My  dear  Poirot! 
1395,geco,2-15,"What  on  earth  is  the  good  of  that,  now  that  we  know  about  the  cocoa? "
1396,geco,2-16,"Oh,  la  la! "
1397,geco,2-17,That  miserable  cocoa!  cried  Poirot  flippantly. 
1398,geco,2-18,"He  laughed  with  apparent  enjoyment,  raising  his  arms  to  heaven  in  mock  despair,  in  what  I  could  not  but  consider  the  worst  possible  taste. "
1399,geco,2-19,"And,  anyway,  I  said,  with  increasing  coldness,  as  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  took  her  coffee  upstairs  with  her,  I  do  not  see  what  you  expect  to  find,  unless  you  consider  it  likely  that  we  shall  discover  a  packet  of  strychnine  on  the  coffee  tray! "
1400,geco,2-20,Poirot  was  sobered  at  once. 
1401,geco,2-21,"Come,  come,  my  friend,  he  said,  slipping  his  arms  through  mine. "
1402,geco,2-22,Ne  vous  fachez  pas! 
1403,geco,2-23,"Allow  me  to  interest  myself  in  my  coffee-cups,  coffee-cups,  and  I  will  respect  your  cocoa. "
1404,geco,2-24,There! 
1405,geco,2-25,Is  it  a  bargain? 
1406,geco,2-26,"He  was  so  quaintly  humorous  that  I  was  forced  to  laugh;  and  we  went  together  to  the  drawing-room,  where  the  coffee-cups  and  tray  remained  undisturbed  as  we  had  left  them. "
1407,geco,2-27,"Poirot  made  me  recapitulate  the  scene  of  the  night  before,  listening  very  carefully,  and  verifying  the  position  of  the  various  cups. "
1408,geco,2-28,So  Mr.s.  Cavendish  stood  by  the  tray...and  poured  out. 
1409,geco,2-29,Yes. 
1410,geco,2-30,Then  she  came  across  to  the  window  where  you  sat  with  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. 
1411,geco,2-31,Yes. 
1412,geco,2-32,Here  are  the  three  cups. 
1413,geco,2-33,"And  the  cup  on  the  mantel-piece,  half  drunk,  that  would  be  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish's. "
1414,geco,2-34,And  the  one  on  the  tray? 
1415,geco,2-35,John  Cavendish's. 
1416,geco,2-36,I  saw  him  put  it  down  there. 
1417,geco,2-37,Good. 
1418,geco,2-38,"One,  two,  three,  four,  five...but  where,  then,  is  the  cup  of  Mr.  Inglethorp? "
1419,geco,2-39,He  does  not  take  coffee. 
1420,geco,2-40,Then  all  are  accounted  for. 
1421,geco,2-41,"One  moment,  my  friend. "
1422,geco,2-42,"With  infinite  care,  he  took  a  drop  or  two  from  the  grounds  in  each  cup,  sealing  them  up  in  separate  test  tubes,  tasting  each  in  turn  as  he  did  so. "
1423,geco,2-43,His  physiognomy  underwent  a  curious  change. 
1424,geco,2-44,"An  expression  gathered  there  that  I  can  only  describe  as  half  puzzled,  and  half  relieved. "
1425,geco,2-45,Bien!  he  said  at  last. 
1426,geco,2-46,It  is  evident! 
1427,geco,2-47,I  had  an  idea...but  clearly  I  was  mistaken. 
1428,geco,2-48,"Yes,  altogether  I  was  mistaken. "
1429,geco,2-49,Yet  it  is  strange. 
1430,geco,2-50,But  no  matter! 
1431,geco,2-51,"And,  with  a  characteristic  shrug,  he  dismissed  whatever  it  was  that  was  worrying  him  from  his  mind. "
1432,geco,2-52,"I  could  have  told  him  from  the  beginning  that  this  obsession  of  his  over  the  coffee  was  bound  to  end  in  a  blind  alley,  but  I  restrained  my  tongue. "
1433,geco,2-53,"After  all,  though  he  was  old,  Poirot  had  been  a  great  man  in  his  day. "
1434,geco,2-54,"Breakfast  is  ready,  said  John  Cavendish,  coming  in  from  the  hall. "
1435,geco,2-55,"You  will  breakfast  with  us,  Monsieur  Poirot? "
1436,geco,2-56,Poirot  acquiesced. 
1437,geco,2-57,I  observed  John. 
1438,geco,2-58,Already  he  was  almost  restored  to  his  normal  self. 
1439,geco,2-59,"The  shock  of  the  events  of  the  last  night  had  upset  him  temporarily,  but  his  equable  poise  soon  swung  back  to  the  normal. "
1440,geco,2-60,"He  was  a  man  of  very  little  imagination,  in  sharp  contrast  with  his  brother,  who  had,  perhaps,  too  much. "
1441,geco,2-61,"Ever  since  the  early  hours  of  the  morning,  John  had  been  hard  at  work,  sending  telegrams...one  of  the  first  had  gone  to  Evelyn  Howard...writing  notices  for  the  papers,  and  generally  occupying  himself  with  the  melancholy  duties  that  a  death  entails. "
1442,geco,2-62,May  I  ask  how  things  are  proceeding?  he  said. 
1443,geco,2-63,Do  your  investigations  point  to  my  mother  having  died  a  natural  death...or...or  must  we  prepare  ourselves  for  the  worst? 
1444,geco,2-64,"I  think,  Mr.  Cavendish,  said  Poirot  gravely,  that  you  would  do  well  not  to  buoy  yourself  up  with  any  false  hopes. "
1445,geco,2-65,Can  you  tell  me  the  views  of  the  other  members  of  the  family? 
1446,geco,2-66,My  brother  Lawrence  is  convinced  that  we  are  making  a  fuss  over  nothing. 
1447,geco,2-67,He  says  that  everything  points  to  its  being  a  simple  case  of  heart  failure. 
1448,geco,2-68,"He  does,  does  he? "
1449,geco,2-69,"That  is  very  interesting...very  interesting,  murmured  Poirot  softly. "
1450,geco,2-70,And  Mr.s.  Cavendish? 
1451,geco,2-71,A  faint  cloud  passed  over  John's  face. 
1452,geco,2-72,I  have  not  the  least  idea  what  my  wife's  views  on  the  subject  are. 
1453,geco,2-73,The  answer  brought  a  momentary  stiffness  in  its  train. 
1454,geco,2-74,"John  broke  the  rather  awkward  silence  by  saying  with  a  slight  effort:  I  told  you,  didn't  I,  that  Mr.  Inglethorp  has  returned? "
1455,geco,2-75,Poirot  bent  his  head. 
1456,geco,2-76,It's  an  awkward  position  for  all  of  us. 
1457,geco,2-77,"Of  course  one  has  to  treat  him  as  usual...but,  hang  it  all,  one's  gorge  does  rise  at  sitting  down  to  eat  with  a  possible  murderer! "
1458,geco,2-78,Poirot  nodded  sympathetically. 
1459,geco,2-79,I  quite  understand. 
1460,geco,2-80,"It  is  a  very  difficult  situation  for  you,  Mr.  Cavendish. "
1461,geco,2-81,I  would  like  to  ask  you  one  question. 
1462,geco,2-82,"Mr.  Inglethorp's  reason  for  not  returning  last  night  was,  I  believe,  that  he  had  forgotten  the  latch-key. "
1463,geco,2-83,Is  not  that  so? 
1464,geco,2-84,Yes. 
1465,geco,2-85,I  suppose  you  are  quite  sure  that  the  latch-key  was  forgotten...that  he  did  not  take  it  after  all? 
1466,geco,2-86,I  have  no  idea. 
1467,geco,2-87,I  never  thought  of  looking. 
1468,geco,2-88,We  always  keep  it  in  the  hall  drawer. 
1469,geco,2-89,I'll  go  and  see  if  it's  there  now. 
1470,geco,2-90,Poirot  held  up  his  hand  with  a  faint  smile. 
1471,geco,2-91,"No,  no,  Mr.  Cavendish,  it  is  too  late  now. "
1472,geco,2-92,I  am  certain  that  you  would  find  it. 
1473,geco,2-93,"If  Mr.  Inglethorp  did  take  it,  he  has  had  ample  time  to  replace  it  by  now. "
1474,geco,2-94,But  do  you  think...... 
1475,geco,2-95,I think  nothing. 
1476,geco,2-96,"If  anyone  had  chanced  to  look  this  morning  before  his  return,  and  seen  it  there,  it  would  have  been  a  valuable  point  in  his  favour. "
1477,geco,2-97,That  is  all. 
1478,geco,2-98,John  looked  perplexed. 
1479,geco,2-99,"Do  not  worry,  said  Poirot  smoothly. "
1480,geco,2-100,I  assure  you  that  you  need  not  let  it  trouble  you. 
1481,geco,2-101,"Since  you  are  so  kind,  let  us  go  and  have  some  breakfast. "
1482,geco,2-102,Every  one  was  assembled  in  the  dining-room. 
1483,geco,2-103,dining-room. 
1484,geco,2-104,"Under  the  circumstances,  we  were  naturally  not  a  cheerful  party. "
1485,geco,2-105,"The  reaction  after  a  shock  is  always  trying,  and  I  think  we  were  all  suffering  from  it. "
1486,geco,2-106,"Decorum  and  good  breeding  naturally  enjoined  that  our  demeanour  should  be  much  as  usual,  yet  I  could  not  help  wondering  if  this  self-control  were  really  a  matter  of  great  difficulty. "
1487,geco,2-107,"There  were  no  red  eyes,  no  signs  of  secretly  indulged  grief. "
1488,geco,2-108,I  felt  that  I  was  right  in  my  opinion  that  Dorcas  was  the  person  most  affected  by  the  personal  side  of  the  tragedy. 
1489,geco,2-109,"I  pass  over  Alfred  Inglethorp,  who  acted  the  bereaved  widower  in  a  manner  that  I  felt  to  be  disgusting  in  its  hypocrisy. "
1490,geco,2-110,"Did  he  know  that  we  suspected  him,  I  wondered. "
1491,geco,2-111,"Surely  he  could  not  be  unaware  of  the  fact,  conceal  it  as  we  would. "
1492,geco,2-112,"Did  he  feel  some  secret  stirring  of  fear,  or  was  he  confident  that  his  crime  would  go  unpunished? "
1493,geco,2-113,Surely  the  suspicion  in  the  atmosphere  must  warn  him  that  he  was  already  a  marked  man. 
1494,geco,2-114,But  did  every  one  suspect  him? 
1495,geco,2-115,What  about  Mr.s.  Cavendish? 
1496,geco,2-116,"I  watched  her  as  she  sat  at  the  head  of  the  table,  graceful,  composed,  enigmatic. "
1497,geco,2-117,"In  her  soft  grey  frock,  with  white  ruffles  at  the  wrists  falling  over  her  slender  hands,  she  looked  very  beautiful. "
1498,geco,2-118,"When  she  chose,  however,  her  face  could  be  sphinx-like  in  its  inscrutability. "
1499,geco,2-119,"She  was  very  silent,  hardly  opening  her  lips,  and  yet  in  some  queer  way  I  felt  that  the  great  strength  of  her  personality  was  dominating  us  all. "
1500,geco,2-120,And  little  Cynthia? 
1501,geco,2-121,Did  she  suspect? 
1502,geco,2-122,"She  looked  very  tired  and  ill,  I  thought. "
1503,geco,2-123,The  heaviness  and  languor  of  her  manner  were  very  marked. 
1504,geco,2-124,"I  asked  her  if  she  were  feeling  ill,  and  she  answered  frankly:  Yes,  I've  got  the  most  beastly  headache. "
1505,geco,2-125,"Have  another  cup  of  coffee,  mademoiselle?  said  Poirot  solicitously. "
1506,geco,2-126,It  will  revive  you. 
1507,geco,2-127,It  is  unparalleled  for  the  mal  de  tete. 
1508,geco,2-128,He  jumped  up  and  took  her  cup. 
1509,geco,2-129,"No  sugar,  said  Cynthia,  watching  him,  as  he  picked  up  the  sugar-tongs. "
1510,geco,2-130,sugar-tongs. 
1511,geco,2-131,No  sugar? 
1512,geco,2-132,"You  abandon  it  in  the  war-time,  eh? "
1513,geco,2-133,"No,  I  never  take  it  in  coffee. "
1514,geco,2-134,Sacre! 
1515,geco,2-135,"murmured  Poirot  to  himself,  as  he  brought  back  the  replenished  cup. "
1516,geco,2-136,"Only  I  heard  him,  and  glancing  up  curiously  at  the  little  man  I  saw  that  his  face  was  working  with  suppressed  excitement,  and  his  eyes  were  as  green  as  a  cat's. "
1517,geco,2-137,He  had  heard  or  seen  something  that  had  affected  him  strongly...but  what  was  it? 
1518,geco,2-138,"I  do  not  usually  label  myself  as  dense,  but  I  must  confess  that  nothing  out  of  the  ordinary  had  attracted  my  attention. "
1519,geco,2-139,"In  another  moment,  the  door  opened  and  Dorcas  appeared. "
1520,geco,2-140,"Mr.  Wells  to  see  you,  sir,  she  said  to  John. "
1521,geco,2-141,I  remembered  the  name  as  being  that  of  the  lawyer  to  whom  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  written  the  night  before. 
1522,geco,2-142,John  rose  immediately. 
1523,geco,2-143,Show  him  into  my  study. 
1524,geco,2-144,Then  he  turned  to  us. 
1525,geco,2-145,"My  mother's  lawyer,  he  explained. "
1526,geco,2-146,And  in  a  lower  voice:  He  is  also  Coroner...you  Coroner...you  understand. 
1527,geco,2-147,Perhaps  you  would  like  to  come  with  me? 
1528,geco,2-148,We  acquiesced  and  followed  him  out  of  the  room. 
1529,geco,2-149,John  strode  on  ahead  and  I  took  the  opportunity  of  whispering  to  Poirot:  There  will  be  an  inquest  then? 
1530,geco,2-150,Poirot  nodded  absently. 
1531,geco,2-151,He  seemed  absorbed  in  thought;  so  much  so  that  my  curiosity  was  aroused. 
1532,geco,2-152,What  is  it? 
1533,geco,2-153,You  are  not  attending  to  what  I  say. 
1534,geco,2-154,"It  is  true,  my  friend. "
1535,geco,2-155,I  am  much  worried. 
1536,geco,2-156,Why? 
1537,geco,2-157,Because  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  does  not  take  sugar  in  her  coffee. 
1538,geco,2-158,What? 
1539,geco,2-159,You  cannot  be  serious? 
1540,geco,2-160,But  I  am  most  serious. 
1541,geco,2-161,"Ah,  there  is  something  there  that  I  do  not  understand. "
1542,geco,2-162,My  instinct  was  right. 
1543,geco,2-163,What  instinct? 
1544,geco,2-164,The  instinct  that  led  me  to  insist  on  examining  those  coffee-cups. 
1545,geco,2-165,Chut! 
1546,geco,2-166,no  more  now! 
1547,geco,2-167,"We  followed  John  into  his  study,  and  he  closed  the  door  behind  us. "
1548,geco,2-168,"Mr.  Wells  was  a  pleasant  man  of  middle-age,  with  keen  eyes,  and  the  typical  lawyer's  mouth. "
1549,geco,2-169,"John  introduced  us  both,  and  explained  the  reason  of  our  presence. "
1550,geco,2-170,"You  will  understand,  Wells,  he  added,  that  this  is  all  strictly  private. "
1551,geco,2-171,We  are  still  hoping  that  there  will  turn  out  to  be  no  need  for  investigation  of  any  kind. 
1552,geco,2-172,"Quite  so,  quite  so,  said  Mr.  Wells  soothingly. "
1553,geco,2-173,"I  wish  we  could  have  spared  you  the  pain  and  publicity  of  an  inquest,  but  of  course  it's  quite  unavoidable  in  the  absence  of  a  doctor's  certificate. "
1554,geco,2-174,"Yes,  I  suppose  so. "
1555,geco,2-175,"Clever  man,  Bauerstein. "
1556,geco,2-176,"Great  authority  on  toxicology,  I  believe. "
1557,geco,2-177,"Indeed,  said  John  with  a  certain  stiffness  in  his  manner. "
1558,geco,2-178,"Then  he  added  rather  hesitatingly:  Shall  we  have  to  appear  as  witnesses...all  of  us,  I  mean? "
1559,geco,2-179,"You,  of  course...and  ah...er...Mr....er...Inglethorp. "
1560,geco,2-180,"A  slight  pause  ensued  before  the  lawyer  went  on  in  his  soothing  manner:  Any  other  evidence  will  be  simply  confirmatory,  a  mere  matter  of  form. "
1561,geco,2-181,I  see. 
1562,geco,2-182,A  faint  expression  of  relief  swept  over  John's  face. 
1563,geco,2-183,"It  puzzled  me,  for  I  saw  no  occasion  for  it. "
1564,geco,2-184,"If  you  know  of  nothing  to  the  contrary,  pursued  Mr.  Wells,  I  had  thought  of  Friday. "
1565,geco,2-185,That  will  give  us  plenty  of  time  for  the  doctor's  report. 
1566,geco,2-186,"The  post-mortem  is  to  take  place  tonight,  I  believe? "
1567,geco,2-187,Yes. 
1568,geco,2-188,Then  that  arrangement  will  suit  you? 
1569,geco,2-189,Perfectly. 
1570,geco,2-190,"I  need  not  tell  you,  my  dear  Cavendish,  how  distressed  I  am  at  this  most  tragic  affair. "
1571,geco,2-191,"Can  you  give  us  no  help  in  solving  it,  monsieur? "
1572,geco,2-192,"interposed  Poirot,  speaking  for  the  first  time  since  we  had  entered  the  room. "
1573,geco,2-193,I? 
1574,geco,2-194,"Yes,  we  heard  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  wrote  to  you  last  night. "
1575,geco,2-195,You  should  have  received  the  letter  this  morning. 
1576,geco,2-196,"I  did,  but  it  contains  no  information. "
1577,geco,2-197,"It  is  merely  a  note  asking  me  to  call  upon  her  this  morning,  as  she  wanted  my  advice  on  a  matter  of  great  importance. "
1578,geco,2-198,She  gave  you  no  hint  as  to  what  that  matter  might  be? 
1579,geco,2-199,"Unfortunately,  no. "
1580,geco,2-200,"That  is  a  pity,  said  John. "
1581,geco,2-201,"A  great  pity,  agreed  Poirot  gravely. "
1582,geco,2-202,There  was  silence. 
1583,geco,2-203,Poirot  remained  lost  in  thought  for  a  few  minutes. 
1584,geco,2-204,Finally  he  turned  to  the  lawyer  again. Mr. 
1585,geco,2-205,"Wells,  there  is  one  thing  I  should  like  to  ask  you...that  is,  if  it  is  not  against  professional  etiquette. "
1586,geco,2-206,"In  the  event  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  death,  who  would  inherit  her  money? "
1587,geco,2-207,"The  lawyer  hesitated  a  moment,  and  then  replied:  The  knowledge  will  be  public  property  very  soon,  so  if  Mr.  Cavendish  does  not  object...... "
1588,geco,2-208,"Not at  all,  interpolated  John. "
1589,geco,2-209,I  do  not  see  any  reason  why  I  should  not  answer  your  question. 
1590,geco,2-210,"By  her  last  will,  dated  August  of  last  year,  after  various  unimportant  legacies  to  servants,  etc., "
1591,geco,2-211,"she  gave  her  entire  fortune  to  her  stepson,  Mr.  John  Cavendish. "
1592,geco,2-212,"Was  not  that...pardon  the  question,  Mr.  Cavendish...rather  unfair  to  her  other  stepson,  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish? "
1593,geco,2-213,"No,  I  do  not  think  so. "
1594,geco,2-214,"You  see,  under  the  terms  of  their  father's  will,  while  John  inherited  the  property,  Lawrence,  at  his  stepmother's  death,  would  come  into  a  considerable  sum  of  money. "
1595,geco,2-215,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  left  her  money  to  her  elder  stepson,  knowing  that  he  would  have  to  keep  up  Styles. "
1596,geco,2-216,"It  was,  to  my  mind,  a  very  fair  and  equitable  distribution. "
1597,geco,2-217,Poirot  nodded  thoughtfully. 
1598,geco,2-218,I  see. 
1599,geco,2-219,"But  I  am  right  in  saying,  am  I  not,  that  by  your  English  law  that  will  was  automatically  revoked  when  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  remarried? "
1600,geco,2-220,Mr.  Wells  bowed  his  head. 
1601,geco,2-221,"As  I  was  about  to  proceed,  Monsieur  Poirot,  that  document  is  now  null  and  void. "
1602,geco,2-222,Hein!  said  Poirot. 
1603,geco,2-223,"He  reflected  for  a  moment,  and  then  asked:  Was  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  herself  aware  of  that  fact? "
1604,geco,2-224,I  do  not  know. 
1605,geco,2-225,She  may  have  been. 
1606,geco,2-226,"She  was,  said  John  unexpectedly. "
1607,geco,2-227,We  were  discussing  the  matter  of  wills  being  revoked  by  marriage  only  yesterday. 
1608,geco,2-228,Ah! 
1609,geco,2-229,"One  more  question,  Mr.  Wells. "
1610,geco,2-230,You  say  'her  last  will.' 
1611,geco,2-231,"Had  Mr.s.  Inglethorp,  then,  made  several  former  wills? "
1612,geco,2-232,"On  an  average,  she  made  a  new  will  at  least  once  a  year,  said  Mr.  Wells  imperturbably. "
1613,geco,2-233,"She  was  given  to  changing  her  mind  as  to  her  testamentary  dispositions,  now  benefiting  one,  now  another  member  of  her  family. "
1614,geco,2-234,"Suppose,  suggested  Poirot,  that,  unknown  to  you,  she  had  made  a  new  will  in  favour  of  some  one  who  was  not,  in  any  sense  of  the  word,  a  member  of  the  family...we  will  say  Miss  Howard,  for  instance...would  you  be  surprised? "
1615,geco,2-235,Not  in  the  least. 
1616,geco,2-236,Ah! 
1617,geco,2-237,Poirot  seemed  to  have  exhausted  his  questions. 
1618,geco,2-238,"I  drew  close  to  him,  while  John  and  the  lawyer  were  debating  the  question  of  going  through  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  papers. "
1619,geco,2-239,"Do  you  think  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  made  a  will  leaving  all  her  money  to  Miss  Howard?  I  asked  in  a  low  voice,  with  some  curiosity. "
1620,geco,2-240,Poirot  smiled. 
1621,geco,2-241,No. 
1622,geco,2-242,Then  why  did  you  ask? 
1623,geco,2-243,Hush! 
1624,geco,2-244,John  Cavendish  had  turned  to  Poirot. 
1625,geco,2-245,"Will  you  come  with  us,  Monsieur  Poirot? "
1626,geco,2-246,We  are  going  through  my  mother's  papers. 
1627,geco,2-247,Mr.  Inglethorp  is  quite  willing  to  leave  it  entirely  to  Mr.  Wells  and  myself. 
1628,geco,2-248,"Which  simplifies  matters  very  much,  murmured  the  lawyer. "
1629,geco,2-249,"As  technically,  of  course,  he  was  entitled......  He  did  not  finish  the  sentence. "
1630,geco,2-250,"We  will  look  through  the  desk  in  the  boudoir  first,  explained  John,  and  go  up  to  her  bedroom  afterwards. "
1631,geco,2-251,"She  kept  her  most  important  papers  in  a  purple  despatch-case,  which  we  must  look  through  carefully. "
1632,geco,2-252,"Yes,  said  the  lawyer,  it  is  quite  possible  that  there  may  be  a  later  will  than  the  one  in  my  possession. "
1633,geco,2-253,There  is  a  later  will. 
1634,geco,2-254,It  was  Poirot  who  spoke. 
1635,geco,2-255,What? 
1636,geco,2-256,John  and  the  lawyer  looked  at  him  startled. 
1637,geco,2-257,"Or,  rather,  pursued  my  friend  imperturbably,  there  was  one. "
1638,geco,2-258,What  do  you  mean...there  was  one? 
1639,geco,2-259,Where  is  it  now? 
1640,geco,2-260,Burnt! 
1641,geco,2-261,Burnt? 
1642,geco,2-262,Yes. 
1643,geco,2-263,See  here. 
1644,geco,2-264,"He  took  out  the  charred  fragment  we  had  found  in  the  grate  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room,  and  handed  it  to  the  lawyer  with  a  brief  explanation  of  when  and  where  he  had  found  it. "
1645,geco,2-265,But  possibly  this  is  an  old  will? 
1646,geco,2-266,I  do  not  think  so. 
1647,geco,2-267,In  fact  I  am  almost  certain  that  it  was  made  no  earlier  than  yesterday  afternoon. 
1648,geco,2-268,What? 
1649,geco,2-269,Impossible! 
1650,geco,2-270,broke  simultaneously  from  both  men. 
1651,geco,2-271,Poirot  turned  to  John. 
1652,geco,2-272,"If  you  will  allow  me  to  send  for  your  gardener,  I  will  prove  it  to  you. "
1653,geco,2-273,"Oh,  of  course...but  I  don't  see...... "
1654,geco,2-274,Poirot raised  his  hand. 
1655,geco,2-275,Do  as  I  ask  you. 
1656,geco,2-276,Afterwards  you  shall  question  as  much  as  you  please. 
1657,geco,2-277,Very  well. 
1658,geco,2-278,He  rang  the  bell. 
1659,geco,2-279,Dorcas  answered  it  in  due  course. 
1660,geco,2-280,"Dorcas,  will  you  tell  Manning  to  come  round  and  speak  to  me  here. "
1661,geco,2-281,"Yes,  sir. "
1662,geco,2-282,Dorcas  withdrew. 
1663,geco,2-283,We  waited  in  a  tense  silence. 
1664,geco,2-284,"Poirot  alone  seemed  perfectly  at  his  ease,  and  dusted  a  forgotten  corner  of  the  bookcase. "
1665,geco,2-285,The  clumping  of  hobnailed  boots  on  the  gravel  outside  proclaimed  the  approach  of  Manning. 
1666,geco,2-286,John  looked  questioningly  at  Poirot. 
1667,geco,2-287,The  latter  nodded. 
1668,geco,2-288,"Come  inside,  Manning,  said  John,  I  want  to  speak  to  you. "
1669,geco,2-289,"Manning  came  slowly  and  hesitatingly  through  the  French  window,  and  stood  as  near  it  as  he  could. "
1670,geco,2-290,"He  held  his  cap  in  his  hands,  twisting  it  very  carefully  round  and  round. "
1671,geco,2-291,"His  back  was  much  bent,  though  he  was  probably  not  as  old  as  he  looked,  but  his  eyes  were  sharp  and  intelligent,  and  belied  his  slow  and  rather  cautious  speech. "
1672,geco,2-292,"Manning,  said  John,  this  gentleman  will  put  some  questions  to  you  which  I  want  you  to  answer. "
1673,geco,2-293,"Yes  sir,  mumbled  Manning. "
1674,geco,2-294,Poirot  stepped  forward  briskly. 
1675,geco,2-295,Manning's  eye  swept  over  him  with  a  faint  contempt. 
1676,geco,2-296,"You  were  planting  a  bed  of  begonias  round  by  the  south  side  of  the  house  yesterday  afternoon,  were  you  not,  Manning? "
1677,geco,2-297,"Yes,  sir,  me  and  Willum. "
1678,geco,2-298,"And  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  came  to  the  window  and  called  you,  did  she  not? "
1679,geco,2-299,"Yes,  sir,  she  did. "
1680,geco,2-300,Tell  me  in  your  own  words  exactly  what  happened  after  that. 
1681,geco,2-301,"Well,  sir,  nothing  much. "
1682,geco,2-302,"She  just  told  Willum  to  go  on  his  bicycle  down  to  the  village,  and  bring  back  a  form  of  will,  or  such-like...I  don't  know  what  exactly...she  wrote  it  down  for  him. "
1683,geco,2-303,Well? 
1684,geco,2-304,"Well,  he  did,  sir. "
1685,geco,2-305,And  what  happened  next? 
1686,geco,2-306,"We  went  on  with  the  begonias,  sir. "
1687,geco,2-307,Did  not  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  call  you  again? 
1688,geco,2-308,"Yes,  sir,  both  me  and  Willum,  she  called. "
1689,geco,2-309,And  then? 
1690,geco,2-310,"She  made  us  come  right  in,  and  sign  our  names  at  the  bottom  of  a  long  paper...under  paper...under  where  she'd  signed. "
1691,geco,2-311,Did  you  see  anything  of  what  was  written  above  her  signature?  asked  Poirot  sharply. 
1692,geco,2-312,"No,  sir,  there  was  a  bit  of  blotting  paper  over  that  part. "
1693,geco,2-313,And  you  signed  where  she  told  you? 
1694,geco,2-314,"Yes,  sir,  first  me  and  then  Willum. "
1695,geco,2-315,What  did  she  do  with  it  afterwards? 
1696,geco,2-316,"Well,  sir,  she  slipped  it  into  a  long  envelope,  and  put  it  inside  a  sort  of  purple  box  that  was  standing  on  the  desk. "
1697,geco,2-317,What  time  was  it  when  she  first  called  you? 
1698,geco,2-318,"About  four,  I  should  say,  sir. "
1699,geco,2-319,Not  earlier? 
1700,geco,2-320,Couldn't  it  have  been  about  half-past  three? 
1701,geco,2-321,"No,  I  shouldn't  say  so,  sir. "
1702,geco,2-322,It  would  be  more  likely  to  be  a  bit  after  four...not  before  it. 
1703,geco,2-323,"Thank  you,  Manning,  that  will  do,  said  Poirot  pleasantly. "
1704,geco,2-324,"The  gardener  glanced  at  his  master,  who  nodded,  whereupon  Manning  lifted  a  finger  to  his  forehead  with  a  low  mumble,  and  backed  cautiously  out  of  the  window. "
1705,geco,2-325,We  all  looked  at  each  other. 
1706,geco,2-326,Good  heavens! 
1707,geco,2-327,murmured  John. 
1708,geco,2-328,What  an  extraordinary  coincidence. 
1709,geco,2-329,How...a  coincidence? 
1710,geco,2-330,That  my  mother  should  have  made  a  will  on  the  very  day  of  her  death! 
1711,geco,2-331,"Mr.  Wells  cleared  his  throat  and  remarked  drily:  Are  you  so  sure  it  is  a  coincidence,  Cavendish? "
1712,geco,2-332,What  do  you  mean? 
1713,geco,2-333,"Your  mother,  you  tell  me,  had  a  violent  quarrel  with...some  one  yesterday  afternoon...... "
1714,geco,2-334,What do  you  mean?  cried  John  again. 
1715,geco,2-335,"There  was  a  tremor  in  his  voice,  and  he  had  gone  very  pale. "
1716,geco,2-336,"In  consequence  of  that  quarrel,  your  mother  very  suddenly  and  hurriedly  makes  a  new  will. "
1717,geco,2-337,The  contents  of  that  will  we  shall  never  know. 
1718,geco,2-338,She  told  no  one  of  its  provisions. 
1719,geco,2-339,"This  morning,  no  doubt,  she  would  have  consulted  me  on  the  subject...but  subject...but  she  had  no  chance. "
1720,geco,2-340,"The  will  disappears,  and  she  takes  its  secret  with  her  to  her  grave. "
1721,geco,2-341,"Cavendish,  I  much  fear  there  is  no  coincidence  there. "
1722,geco,2-342,"Monsieur  Poirot,  I  am  sure  you  agree  with  me  that  the  facts  are  very  suggestive. "
1723,geco,2-343,"Suggestive,  or  not,  interrupted  John,  we  are  most  grateful  to  Monsieur  Poirot  for  elucidating  the  matter. "
1724,geco,2-344,"But  for  him,  we  should  never  have  known  of  this  will. "
1725,geco,2-345,"I  suppose,  I  may  not  ask  you,  monsieur,  what  first  led  you  to  suspect  the  fact? "
1726,geco,2-346,"Poirot  smiled  and  answered:  A  scribbled  over  old  envelope,  and  a  freshly  planted  bed  of  begonias. "
1727,geco,2-347,"John,  I  think,  would  have  pressed  his  questions  further,  but  at  that  moment  the  loud  purr  of  a  motor  was  audible,  and  we  all  turned  to  the  window  as  it  swept  past. "
1728,geco,2-348,Evie!  cried  John. 
1729,geco,2-349,"Excuse  me,  Wells. "
1730,geco,2-350,He  went  hurriedly  out  into  the  hall. 
1731,geco,2-351,Poirot  looked  inquiringly  at  me. 
1732,geco,2-352,"Miss  Howard,  I  explained. "
1733,geco,2-353,"Ah,  I  am  glad  she  has  come. "
1734,geco,2-354,"There  is  a  woman  with  a  head  and  a  heart  too,  Hastings. "
1735,geco,2-355,Though  the  good  God  gave  her  no  beauty! 
1736,geco,2-356,"I  followed  John's  example,  and  went  out  into  the  hall,  where  Miss  Howard  was  endeavouring  to  extricate  herself  from  the  voluminous  mass  of  veils  that  enveloped  her  head. "
1737,geco,2-357,"As  her  eyes  fell  on  me,  a  sudden  pang  of  guilt  shot  through  me. "
1738,geco,2-358,"This  was  the  woman  who  had  warned  me  so  earnestly,  and  to  whose  warning  I  had,  alas,  paid  no  heed! "
1739,geco,2-359,"How  soon,  and  how  contemptuously,  I  had  dismissed  it  from  my  mind. "
1740,geco,2-360,"Now  that  she  had  been  proved  justified  in  so  tragic  a  manner,  I  felt  ashamed. "
1741,geco,2-361,She  had  known  Alfred  Inglethorp  only  too  well. 
1742,geco,2-362,"I  wondered  whether,  if  she  had  remained  at  Styles,  the  tragedy  would  have  taken  place,  or  would  the  man  have  feared  her  watchful  eyes? "
1743,geco,2-363,"I  was  relieved  when  she  shook  me  by  the  hand,  with  her  well  remembered  painful  grip. "
1744,geco,2-364,"The  eyes  that  met  mine  were  sad,  but  not  reproachful;  that  she  had  been  crying  bitterly,  I  could  tell  by  the  redness  of  her  eyelids,  but  her  manner  was  unchanged  from  its  old  gruffness. "
1745,geco,2-365,Started  the  moment  I  got  the  wire. 
1746,geco,2-366,Just  come  off  night  duty. 
1747,geco,2-367,Hired  car. 
1748,geco,2-368,Quickest  way  to  get  here. 
1749,geco,2-369,"Have  you  had  anything  to  eat  this  morning,  Evie?  asked  John. "
1750,geco,2-370,No. 
1751,geco,2-371,I  thought  not. 
1752,geco,2-372,"Come  along,  breakfast's  not  cleared  away  yet,  and  they'll  make  you  some  fresh  tea. "
1753,geco,2-373,He  turned  to  me. 
1754,geco,2-374,"Look  after  her,  Hastings,  will  you? "
1755,geco,2-375,Wells  is  waiting  for  me. 
1756,geco,2-376,"Oh,  here's  Monsieur  Poirot. "
1757,geco,2-377,"He's  helping  us,  you  know,  Evie. "
1758,geco,2-378,"Miss  Howard  shook  hands  with  Poirot,  but  glanced  suspiciously  over  her  shoulder  at  John. "
1759,geco,2-379,What  do  you  mean...helping  us? 
1760,geco,2-380,Helping  us  to  investigate. 
1761,geco,2-381,Nothing  to  investigate. 
1762,geco,2-382,Have  they  taken  him  to  prison  yet? 
1763,geco,2-383,Taken  who  to  prison? 
1764,geco,2-384,Who? 
1765,geco,2-385,"Alfred  Inglethorp,  of  course! "
1766,geco,2-386,"My  dear  Evie,  do  be  careful. "
1767,geco,2-387,Lawrence  is  of  the  opinion  that  my  mother  died  from  heart  seizure. 
1768,geco,2-388,"More  fool,  Lawrence! "
1769,geco,2-389,retorted  Miss  Howard. 
1770,geco,2-390,Of  course  Alfred  Inglethorp  murdered  poor  Emily...as  I  always  told  you  he  would. 
1771,geco,2-391,"My  dear  Evie,  don't  shout  so. "
1772,geco,2-392,"Whatever  we  may  think  or  suspect,  it  is  better  to  say  as  little  as  possible  for  the  present. "
1773,geco,2-393,The  inquest  isn't  until  Friday. 
1774,geco,2-394,Not  until  fiddlesticks! 
1775,geco,2-395,The  snort  Miss  Howard  gave  was  truly  magnificent. 
1776,geco,2-396,You're  all  off  your  heads. 
1777,geco,2-397,The  man  will  be  out  of  the  country  by  then. 
1778,geco,2-398,"If  he's  any  sense,  he  won't  stay  here  tamely  and  wait  to  be  hanged. "
1779,geco,2-399,John  Cavendish  looked  at  her  helplessly. 
1780,geco,2-400,"I  know  what  it  is,  she  accused  him,  you've  been  listening  to  the  doctors. "
1781,geco,2-401,Never  should. 
1782,geco,2-402,What  do  they  know? 
1783,geco,2-403,Nothing  at  all...or  just  enough  to  make  them  dangerous. 
1784,geco,2-404,I  ought  to  know...my  own  father  was  a  doctor. 
1785,geco,2-405,That  little  Wilkins  is  about  the  greatest  fool  that  even  I  have  ever  seen. 
1786,geco,2-406,Heart  seizure! 
1787,geco,2-407,Sort  of  thing  he  would  say. 
1788,geco,2-408,Anyone  with  any  sense  could  see  at  once  that  her  husband  had  poisoned  her. 
1789,geco,2-409,"I  always  said  he'd  murder  her  in  her  bed,  poor  soul. "
1790,geco,2-410,Now  he's  done  it. 
1791,geco,2-411,And  all  you  can  do  is  to  murmur  silly  things  about  'heart  seizure'  and  'inquest  on  Friday.' 
1792,geco,2-412,"You  ought  to  be  ashamed  of  yourself,  John  Cavendish. "
1793,geco,2-413,"What  do  you  want  me  to  do?  asked  John,  unable  to  help  a  faint  smile. "
1794,geco,2-414,"Dash  it  all,  Evie,  I  can't  haul  him  down  to  the  local  police  station  by  the  scruff  of  his  neck. "
1795,geco,2-415,"Well,  you  might  do  something. "
1796,geco,2-416,Find  out  how  he  did  it. 
1797,geco,2-417,He's  a  crafty  beggar. 
1798,geco,2-418,Dare  say  he  soaked  fly  papers. 
1799,geco,2-419,Ask  Cook  if  she's  missed  any. 
1800,geco,2-420,"It  occurred  to  me  very  forcibly  at  that  moment  that  to  harbour  Miss  Howard  and  Alfred  Inglethorp  under  the  same  roof,  and  keep  the  peace  between  them,  was  likely  to  prove  a  Herculean  task,  and  I  did  not  envy  John. "
1801,geco,2-421,I  could  see  by  the  expression  of  his  face  that  he  fully  appreciated  the  difficulty  of  the  position. 
1802,geco,2-422,"For  the  moment,  he  sought  refuge  in  retreat,  and  left  the  room  precipitately. "
1803,geco,2-423,Dorcas  brought  in  fresh  tea. 
1804,geco,2-424,"As  she  left  the  room,  Poirot  came  over  from  the  window  where  he  had  been  standing,  and  sat  down  facing  Miss  Howard. "
1805,geco,2-425,"Mademoiselle,  he  said  gravely,  I  want  to  ask  you  something. "
1806,geco,2-426,"Ask  away,  said  the  lady,  eyeing  him  with  some  disfavour. "
1807,geco,2-427,I  want  to  be  able  to  count  upon  your  help. 
1808,geco,2-428,"I'll  help  you  to  hang  Alfred  with  pleasure,  she  replied  gruffly. "
1809,geco,2-429,Hanging's  too  good  for  him. 
1810,geco,2-430,"Ought  to  be  drawn  and  quartered,  like  in  good  old  times. "
1811,geco,2-431,"We  are  at  one  then,  said  Poirot,  for  I,  too,  want  to  hang  the  criminal. "
1812,geco,2-432,Alfred  Inglethorp? 
1813,geco,2-433,"Him,  or  another. "
1814,geco,2-434,No  question  of  another. 
1815,geco,2-435,Poor  Emily  was  never  murdered  until  he  came  along. 
1816,geco,2-436,I  don't  say  she  wasn't  surrounded  by  sharks...she  was. 
1817,geco,2-437,But  it  was  only  her  purse  they  were  after. 
1818,geco,2-438,Her  life  was  safe  enough. 
1819,geco,2-439,But  along  comes  Mr.  Alfred  Inglethorp...and  within  two  months...hey  presto! 
1820,geco,2-440,"Believe  me,  Miss  Howard,  said  Poirot  very  earnestly,  if  Mr.  Inglethorp  is  the  man,  he  shall  not  escape  me. "
1821,geco,2-441,"On  my  honour,  I  will  hang  him  as  high  as  Haman! "
1822,geco,2-442,"That's  better,  said  Miss  Howard  more  enthusiastically. "
1823,geco,2-443,But  I  must  ask  you  to  trust  me. 
1824,geco,2-444,Now  your  help  may  be  very  valuable  to  me. 
1825,geco,2-445,I  will  tell  you  why. 
1826,geco,2-446,"Because,  in  all  this  house  of  mourning,  yours  are  the  only  eyes  that  have  wept. "
1827,geco,2-447,"Miss  Howard  blinked,  and  a  new  note  crept  into  the  gruffness  of  her  voice. "
1828,geco,2-448,"If  you  mean  that  I  was  fond  of  her...yes,  I  was. "
1829,geco,2-449,"You  know,  Emily  was  a  selfish  old  woman  in  her  way. "
1830,geco,2-450,"She  was  very  generous,  but  she  always  wanted  a  return. "
1831,geco,2-451,"She  never  let  people  forget  what  she  had  done  for  them...and,  that  way  she  missed  love. "
1832,geco,2-452,"Don't  think  she  ever  realized  it,  though,  or  felt  the  lack  of  it. "
1833,geco,2-453,"Hope  not,  anyway. "
1834,geco,2-454,I  was  on  a  different  footing. 
1835,geco,2-455,I  took  my  stand  from  the  first. 
1836,geco,2-456,'So  many  pounds  a  year  I'm  worth  to  you. 
1837,geco,2-457,Well  and  good. 
1838,geco,2-458,"But  not  a  penny  piece  besides...not  besides...not  a  pair  of  gloves,  nor  a  theatre  ticket.' "
1839,geco,2-459,She  didn't  understand...was  very  offended  sometimes. 
1840,geco,2-460,Said  I  was  foolishly  proud. 
1841,geco,2-461,It  wasn't  that...but  I  couldn't  explain. 
1842,geco,2-462,"Anyway,  I  kept  my  self-respect. "
1843,geco,2-463,"And  so,  out  of  the  whole  bunch,  I  was  the  only  one  who  could  allow  myself  to  be  fond  of  her. "
1844,geco,2-464,I  watched  over  her. 
1845,geco,2-465,"I  guarded  her  from  the  lot  of  them,  and  then  a  glib-tongued  scoundrel  comes  along,  and  pooh! "
1846,geco,2-466,all  my  years  of  devotion  go  for  nothing. 
1847,geco,2-467,Poirot  nodded  sympathetically. 
1848,geco,2-468,"I  understand,  mademoiselle,  I  understand  all  you  feel. "
1849,geco,2-469,It  is  most  natural. 
1850,geco,2-470,"You  think  that  we  are  lukewarm...that  we  lack  fire  and  energy...but  trust  me,  it  is  not  so. "
1851,geco,2-471,"John  stuck  his  head  in  at  this  juncture,  and  invited  us  both  to  come  up  to  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room,  as  he  and  Mr.  Wells  had  finished  looking  through  the  desk  in  the  boudoir. "
1852,geco,2-472,"As  we  went  up  the  stairs,  John  looked  back  to  the  dining-room  door,  and  lowered  his  voice  confidentially:  Look  here,  what's  going  to  happen  when  these  two  meet? "
1853,geco,2-473,I  shook  my  head  helplessly. 
1854,geco,2-474,I've  told  Mary  to  keep  them  apart  if  she  can. 
1855,geco,2-475,Will  she  be  able  to  do  so? 
1856,geco,2-476,The  Lord  only  knows. 
1857,geco,2-477,"There's  one  thing,  Inglethorp  himself  won't  be  too  keen  on  meeting  her. "
1858,geco,2-478,"You've  got  the  keys  still,  haven't  you,  Poirot?  I  asked,  as  we  reached  the  door  of  the  locked  room. "
1859,geco,2-479,"Taking  the  keys  from  Poirot,  John  unlocked  it,  and  we  all  passed  in. "
1860,geco,2-480,"The  lawyer  went  straight  to  the  desk,  and  John  followed  him. "
1861,geco,2-481,"My  mother  kept  most  of  her  important  papers  in  this  despatch-case,  I  believe,  he  said. "
1862,geco,2-482,Poirot  drew  out  the  small  bunch  of  keys. 
1863,geco,2-483,Permit  me. 
1864,geco,2-484,"I  locked  it,  out  of  precaution,  this  morning. "
1865,geco,2-485,But  it's  not  locked  now. 
1866,geco,2-486,Impossible! 
1867,geco,2-487,See. 
1868,geco,2-488,And  John  lifted  the  lid  as  he  spoke. 
1869,geco,2-489,"Milles  tonnerres!  cried  Poirot,  dumfounded. "
1870,geco,2-490,And  I...who  have  both  the  keys  in  my  pocket! 
1871,geco,2-491,He  flung  himself  upon  the  case. 
1872,geco,2-492,Suddenly  he  stiffened. 
1873,geco,2-493,En  voila  une  affaire! 
1874,geco,2-494,This  lock  has  been  forced. 
1875,geco,2-495,What? 
1876,geco,2-496,Poirot  laid  down  the  case  again. 
1877,geco,2-497,But  who  forced  it? 
1878,geco,2-498,Why  should  they? 
1879,geco,2-499,When? 
1880,geco,2-500,But  the  door  was  locked? 
1881,geco,2-501,These  exclamations  burst  from  us  disjointedly. 
1882,geco,2-502,Poirot  answered  them  categorically...almost  categorically...almost  mechanically. 
1883,geco,2-503,Who? 
1884,geco,2-504,That  is  the  question. 
1885,geco,2-505,Why? 
1886,geco,2-506,"Ah,  if  I  only  knew. "
1887,geco,2-507,When? 
1888,geco,2-508,Since  I  was  here  an  hour  ago. 
1889,geco,2-509,"As  to  the  door  being  locked,  it  is  a  very  ordinary  lock. "
1890,geco,2-510,Probably  any  other  of  the  doorkeys  in  this  passage  would  fit  it. 
1891,geco,2-511,We  stared  at  one  another  blankly. 
1892,geco,2-512,Poirot  had  walked  over  to  the  mantel-piece. 
1893,geco,2-513,"He  was  outwardly  calm,  but  I  noticed  his  hands,  which  from  long  force  of  habit  were  mechanically  straightening  the  spill  vases  on  the  mantel-piece,  were  shaking  violently. "
1894,geco,2-514,"See  here,  it  was  like  this,  he  said  at  last. "
1895,geco,2-515,"There  was  something  in  that  case...some  piece  of  evidence,  slight  in  itself  perhaps,  but  still  enough  of  a  clue  to  connect  the  murderer  with  the  crime. "
1896,geco,2-516,It  was  vital  to  him  that  it  should  be  destroyed  before  it  was  discovered  and  its  significance  appreciated. 
1897,geco,2-517,"Therefore,  he  took  the  risk,  the  great  risk,  of  coming  in  here. "
1898,geco,2-518,"Finding  the  case  locked,  he  was  obliged  to  force  it,  thus  betraying  his  presence. "
1899,geco,2-519,"For  him  to  take  that  risk,  it  must  have  been  something  of  great  importance. "
1900,geco,2-520,But  what  was  it? 
1901,geco,2-521,"Ah! Cried Poirot,  with  a  gesture  of  anger. "
1902,geco,2-522,"That,  I  do  not  know! "
1903,geco,2-523,"A  document  of  some  kind,  without  doubt,  possibly  the  scrap  of  paper  Dorcas  saw  in  her  hand  yesterday  afternoon. "
1904,geco,2-524,And  I...  his  anger  burst  forth  freely... miserable  freely... miserable  animal  that  I  am! 
1905,geco,2-525,I  guessed  nothing! 
1906,geco,2-526,I  have  behaved  like  an  imbecile! 
1907,geco,2-527,I  should  never  have  left  that  case  here. 
1908,geco,2-528,I  should  have  carried  it  away  with  me. 
1909,geco,2-529,"Ah,  triple  pig! "
1910,geco,2-530,And  now  it  is  gone. 
1911,geco,2-531,It  is  destroyed...but  is  it  destroyed? 
1912,geco,2-532,Is  there  not  yet  a  chance...we  must  leave  no  stone  unturned... 
1913,geco,2-533,"He rushed  like  a  madman  from  the  room,  and  I  followed  him  as  soon  as  I  had  sufficiently  recovered  my  wits. "
1914,geco,2-534,"But,  by  the  time  I  had  reached  the  top  of  the  stairs,  he  was  out  of  sight. "
1915,geco,2-535,"Mary  Cavendish  was  standing  where  the  staircase  branched,  staring  down  into  the  hall  in  the  direction  in  which  he  had  disappeared. "
1916,geco,2-536,"What  has  happened  to  your  extraordinary  little  friend,  Mr.  Hastings? "
1917,geco,2-537,He  has  just  rushed  past  me  like  a  mad  bull. 
1918,geco,2-538,"He's  rather  upset  about  something,  I  remarked  feebly. "
1919,geco,2-539,I  really  did  not  know  how  much  Poirot  would  wish  me  to  disclose. 
1920,geco,2-540,"As  I  saw  a  faint  smile  gather  on  Mr.s.  Cavendish's  expressive  mouth,  I  endeavoured  to  try  and  turn  the  conversation  by  saying:  They  haven't  met  yet,  have  they? "
1921,geco,2-541,Who? 
1922,geco,2-542,Mr.  Inglethorp  and  Miss  Howard. 
1923,geco,2-543,She  looked  at  me  in  rather  a  disconcerting  manner. 
1924,geco,2-544,Do  you  think  it  would  be  such  a  disaster  if  they  did  meet? 
1925,geco,2-545,"Well,  don't  you? "
1926,geco,2-546,"I  said,  rather  taken  aback. "
1927,geco,2-547,No. 
1928,geco,2-548,She  was  smiling  in  her  quiet  way. 
1929,geco,2-549,I  should  like  to  see  a  good  flare  up. 
1930,geco,2-550,It  would  clear  the  air. 
1931,geco,2-551,"At  present  we  are  all  thinking  so  much,  and  saying  so  little. "
1932,geco,2-552,"John  doesn't  think  so,  I  remarked. "
1933,geco,2-553,He's  anxious  to  keep  them  apart. 
1934,geco,2-554,"Oh,  John! "
1935,geco,2-555,"Something  in  her  tone  fired  me,  and  I  blurted  out:  Old  John's  an  awfully  good  sort. "
1936,geco,2-556,"She  studied  me  curiously  for  a  minute  or  two,  and  then  said,  to  my  great  surprise:  You  are  loyal  to  your  friend. "
1937,geco,2-557,I  like  you  for  that. 
1938,geco,2-558,Aren't  you  my  friend  too? 
1939,geco,2-559,I  am  a  very  bad  friend. 
1940,geco,2-560,Why  do  you  say  that? 
1941,geco,2-561,Because  it  is  true. 
1942,geco,2-562,"I  am  charming  to  my  friends  one  day,  and  forget  all  about  them  the  next. "
1943,geco,2-563,"I  don't  know  what  impelled  me,  but  I  was  nettled,  and  I  said  foolishly  and  not  in  the  best  of  taste:  Yet  you  seem  to  be  invariably  charming  to  Dr  Bauerstein! "
1944,geco,2-564,Instantly  I  regretted  my  words. 
1945,geco,2-565,Her  face  stiffened. 
1946,geco,2-566,I  had  the  impression  of  a  steel  curtain  coming  down  and  blotting  out  the  real  woman. 
1947,geco,2-567,"Without  a  word,  she  turned  and  went  swiftly  up  the  stairs,  whilst  I  stood  like  an  idiot  gaping  after  her. "
1948,geco,2-568,I  was  recalled  to  other  matters  by  a  frightful  row  going  on  below. 
1949,geco,2-569,I  could  hear  Poirot  shouting  and  expounding. 
1950,geco,2-570,I  was  vexed  to  think  that  my  diplomacy  had  been  in  vain. 
1951,geco,2-571,"The  little  man  appeared  to  be  taking  the  whole  house  into  his  confidence,  a  proceeding  of  which  I,  for  one,  doubted  the  wisdom. "
1952,geco,2-572,Once  again  I  could  not  help  regretting  that  my  friend  was  so  prone  to  lose  his  head  in  moments  of  excitement. 
1953,geco,2-573,I  stepped  briskly  down  the  stairs. 
1954,geco,2-574,The  sight  of  me  calmed  Poirot  almost  immediately. 
1955,geco,2-575,I  drew  him  aside. 
1956,geco,2-576,"My  dear  fellow,  I  said,  is  this  wise? "
1957,geco,2-577,Surely  you  don't  want  the  whole  house  to  know  of  this  occurrence? 
1958,geco,2-578,You  are  actually  playing  into  the  criminal's  hands. 
1959,geco,2-579,"You  think  so,  Hastings? "
1960,geco,2-580,I  am  sure  of  it. 
1961,geco,2-581,"Well,  well,  my  friend,  I  will  be  guided  by  you. "
1962,geco,2-582,Good. 
1963,geco,2-583,"Although,  unfortunately,  it  is  a  little  too  late  now. "
1964,geco,2-584,Sure. 
1965,geco,2-585,"He  looked  so  crestfallen  and  abashed  that  I  felt  quite  sorry,  though  I  still  thought  my  rebuke  a  just  and  wise  one. "
1966,geco,2-586,"Well,  he  said  at  last,  let  us  go,  mon  ami. "
1967,geco,2-587,You  have  finished  here? 
1968,geco,2-588,"For  the  moment,  yes. "
1969,geco,2-589,You  will  walk  back  with  me  to  the  village? 
1970,geco,2-590,Willingly. 
1971,geco,2-591,"He  picked  up  his  little  suit-case,  and  we  went  out  through  the  open  window  in  the  drawing-room. "
1972,geco,2-592,"Cynthia  Murdoch  was  just  coming  in,  and  Poirot  stood  aside  to  let  her  pass. "
1973,geco,2-593,"Excuse  me,  mademoiselle,  one  minute. "
1974,geco,2-594,Yes? 
1975,geco,2-595,she  turned  inquiringly. 
1976,geco,2-596,Did  you  ever  make  up  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  medicines? 
1977,geco,2-597,"A  slight  flush  rose  in  her  face,  as  she  answered  rather  constrainedly:  No. "
1978,geco,2-598,Only  her  powders? 
1979,geco,2-599,"The  flush  deepened  as  Cynthia  replied:  Oh,  yes,  I  did  make  up  some  sleeping  powders  for  her  once. "
1980,geco,2-600,These? 
1981,geco,2-601,Poirot  produced  the  empty  box  which  had  contained  powders. 
1982,geco,2-602,She  nodded. 
1983,geco,2-603,Can  you  tell  me  what  they  were? 
1984,geco,2-604,Sulphonal? 
1985,geco,2-605,Veronal? 
1986,geco,2-606,"No,  they  were  bromide  powders. "
1987,geco,2-607,Ah! 
1988,geco,2-608,"Thank  you,  mademoiselle;  good  morning. "
1989,geco,2-609,"As  we  walked  briskly  away  from  the  house,  I  glanced  at  him  more  than  once. "
1990,geco,2-610,"I  had  often  before  noticed  that,  if  anything  excited  him,  his  eyes  turned  green  like  a  cat's. "
1991,geco,2-611,They  were  shining  like  emeralds  now. 
1992,geco,2-612,"My  friend,  he  broke  out  at  last,  I  have  a  little  idea,  a  very  strange,  and  probably  utterly  impossible  idea. "
1993,geco,2-613,And  yet...it  fits  in. 
1994,geco,2-614,I  shrugged  my  shoulders. 
1995,geco,2-615,I  privately  thought  that  Poirot  was  rather  too  much  given  to  these  fantastic  ideas. 
1996,geco,2-616,"In  this  case,  surely,  the  truth  was  only  too  plain  and  apparent. "
1997,geco,2-617,"So  that  is  the  explanation  of  the  blank  label  on  the  box,  I  remarked. "
1998,geco,2-618,"Very  simple,  as  you  said. "
1999,geco,2-619,I  really  wonder  that  I  did  not  think  of  it  myself. 
2000,geco,2-620,Poirot  did  not  appear  to  be  listening  to  me. 
2001,geco,2-621,"They  have  made  one  more  discovery,  la-bas,  he  observed,  jerking  his  thumb  over  his  shoulder  in  the  direction  of  Styles. "
2002,geco,2-622,Mr.  Wells  told  me  as  we  were  going  upstairs. 
2003,geco,2-623,What  was  it? 
2004,geco,2-624,"Locked  up  in  the  desk  in  the  boudoir,  they  found  a  will  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's,  dated  before  her  marriage,  leaving  her  fortune  to  Alfred  Inglethorp. "
2005,geco,2-625,It  must  have  been  made  just  at  the  time  they  were  engaged. 
2006,geco,2-626,It  came  quite  as  a  surprise  to  Wells...and  to  John  Cavendish  also. 
2007,geco,2-627,"It  was  written  on  one  of  those  printed  will  forms,  and  witnessed  by  two  of  the  servants...not  Dorcas. "
2008,geco,2-628,Did  Mr.  Inglethorp  know  of  it? 
2009,geco,2-629,He  says  not. 
2010,geco,2-630,"One  might  take  that  with  a  grain  of  salt,  I  remarked  sceptically. "
2011,geco,2-631,All  these  wills  are  very  confusing. 
2012,geco,2-632,"Tell  me,  how  did  those  scribbled  words  on  the  envelope  help  you  to  discover  that  a  will  was  made  yesterday  afternoon? "
2013,geco,2-633,Poirot  smiled. 
2014,geco,2-634,"Mon  ami,  have  you  ever,  when  writing  a  letter,  been  arrested  by  the  fact  that  you  did  not  know  how  to  spell  a  certain  word? "
2015,geco,2-635,"Yes,  often. "
2016,geco,2-636,I  suppose  every  one  has. 
2017,geco,2-637,Exactly. 
2018,geco,2-638,"And  have  you  not,  in  such  a  case,  tried  the  word  once  or  twice  on  the  edge  of  the  blotting-paper,  or  a  spare  scrap  of  paper,  to  see  if  it  looked  right? "
2019,geco,2-639,"Well,  that  is  what  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  did. "
2020,geco,2-640,You  will  notice  that  the  word  'possessed'  is  spelt  first  with  one  's'  and  subsequently  with  two...correctly. 
2021,geco,2-641,"To  make  sure,  she  had  further  tried  it  in  a  sentence,  thus:  'I  am  possessed.' "
2022,geco,2-642,"Now,  what  did  that  tell  me? "
2023,geco,2-643,"It  told  me  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  been  writing  the  word  'possessed'  that  afternoon,  and,  having  the  fragment  of  paper  found  in  the  grate  fresh  in  my  mind,  the  possibility  of  a  will...(a  document  almost  certain  to  contain  that  word)...occurred  to  me  at  once. "
2024,geco,2-644,This  possibility  was  confirmed  by  a  further  circumstance. 
2025,geco,2-645,"In  the  general  confusion,  the  boudoir  had  not  been  swept  that  morning,  and  near  the  desk  were  several  traces  of  brown  mould  and  earth. "
2026,geco,2-646,"The  weather  had  been  perfectly  fine  for  some  days,  and  no  ordinary  boots  would  have  left  such  a  heavy  deposit. "
2027,geco,2-647,"I  strolled  to  the  window,  and  saw  at  once  that  the  begonia  beds  had  been  newly  planted. "
2028,geco,2-648,"The  mould  in  the  beds  was  exactly  similar  to  that  on  the  floor  of  the  boudoir,  and  also  I  learnt  from  you  that  they  had  been  planted  yesterday  afternoon. "
2029,geco,2-649,"I  was  now  sure  that  one,  or  possibly  both  of  the  gardeners...for  there  were  two  sets  of  footprints  in  the  bed...had  entered  the  boudoir,  for  if  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  merely  wished  to  speak  to  them  she  would  in  all  probability  have  stood  at  the  window,  and  they  would  not  have  come  into  the  room  at  all. "
2030,geco,2-650,"I  was  now  quite  convinced  that  she  had  made  a  fresh  will,  and  had  called  the  two  gardeners  in  to  witness  her  signature. "
2031,geco,2-651,Events  proved  that  I  was  right  in  my  supposition. 
2032,geco,2-652,"That  was  very  ingenious,  I  could  not  help  admitting. "
2033,geco,2-653,I  must  confess  that  the  conclusions  I  drew  from  those  few  scribbled  words  were  quite  erroneous. 
2034,geco,2-654,He  smiled. 
2035,geco,2-655,You  gave  too  much  rein  to  your  imagination. 
2036,geco,2-656,"Imagination  is  a  good  servant,  and  a  bad  master. "
2037,geco,2-657,The  simplest  explanation  is  always  the  most  likely. 
2038,geco,2-658,Another  point...how  did  you  know  that  the  key  of  the  despatch-case  had  been  lost? 
2039,geco,2-659,I  did  not  know  it. 
2040,geco,2-660,It  was  a  guess  that  turned  out  to  be  correct. 
2041,geco,2-661,You  observed  that  it  had  a  piece  of  twisted  wire  through  the  handle. 
2042,geco,2-662,That  suggested  to  me  at  once  that  it  had  possibly  been  wrenched  off  a  flimsy  key-ring. 
2043,geco,2-663,"Now,  if  it  had  been  lost  and  recovered,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  would  at  once  have  replaced  it  on  her  bunch;  but  on  her  bunch  I  found  what  was  obviously  the  duplicate  key,  very  new  and  bright,  which  led  me  to  the  hypothesis  that  somebody  else  had  inserted  the  original  key  in  the  lock  of  the  despatch-case. "
2044,geco,2-664,"Yes,  I  said,  Alfred  Inglethorp,  without  doubt. "
2045,geco,2-665,Poirot  looked  at  me  curiously. 
2046,geco,2-666,You  are  very  sure  of  his  guilt? 
2047,geco,2-667,"Well,  naturally. "
2048,geco,2-668,Every  fresh  circumstance  seems  to  establish  it  more  clearly. 
2049,geco,2-669,"On  the  contrary,  said  Poirot  quietly,  there  are  several  points  in  his  favour. "
2050,geco,2-670,"Oh,  come  now! "
2051,geco,2-671,Yes. 
2052,geco,2-672,I  see  only  one. 
2053,geco,2-673,And  that? 
2054,geco,2-674,That  he  was  not  in  the  house  last  night. 
2055,geco,2-675,'Bad  shot!' 
2056,geco,2-676,as  you  English  say! 
2057,geco,2-677,You  have  chosen  the  one  point  that  to  my  mind  tells  against  him. 
2058,geco,2-678,How  is  that? 
2059,geco,2-679,"Because  if  Mr.  Inglethorp  knew  that  his  wife  would  be  poisoned  last  night,  he  would  certainly  have  arranged  to  be  away  from  the  house. "
2060,geco,2-680,His  excuse  was  an  obviously  trumped  up  one. 
2061,geco,2-681,That  leaves  us  two  possibilities:  either  he  knew  what  was  going  to  happen  or  he  had  a  reason  of  his  own  for  his  absence. 
2062,geco,2-682,And  that  reason?  I  asked  sceptically. 
2063,geco,2-683,Poirot  shrugged  his  shoulders. 
2064,geco,2-684,How  should  I  know? 
2065,geco,2-685,"Discreditable,  without  doubt. "
2066,geco,2-686,"This  Mr.  Inglethorp,  I  should  say,  is  somewhat  of  a  scoundrel...but  that  does  not  of  necessity  make  him  a  murderer. "
2067,geco,2-687,"I  shook  my  head,  unconvinced. "
2068,geco,2-688,"We  do  not  agree,  eh?  said  Poirot. "
2069,geco,2-689,"Well,  let  us  leave  it. "
2070,geco,2-690,Time  will  show  which  of  us  is  right. 
2071,geco,2-691,Now  let  us  turn  to  other  aspects  of  the  case. 
2072,geco,2-692,What  do  you  make  of  the  fact  that  all  the  doors  of  the  bedroom  were  bolted  on  the  inside? 
2073,geco,2-693,Well......  I  considered. 
2074,geco,2-694,One  must  look  at  it  logically. 
2075,geco,2-695,True. 
2076,geco,2-696,I  should  put  it  this  way. 
2077,geco,2-697,"The  doors  were  bolted...our  own  eyes  have  told  us  that...yet  the  presence  of  the  candle  grease  on  the  floor,  and  the  destruction  of  the  will,  prove  that  during  the  night  some  one  entered  the  room. "
2078,geco,2-698,You  agree  so  far? 
2079,geco,2-699,Perfectly. 
2080,geco,2-700,Put  with  admirable  clearness. 
2081,geco,2-701,Proceed. 
2082,geco,2-702,"Well,  I  said,  encouraged,  as  the  person  who  entered  did  not  do  so  by  the  window,  nor  by  miraculous  means,  it  follows  that  the  door  must  have  been  opened  from  inside  by  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  herself. "
2083,geco,2-703,That  strengthens  the  conviction  that  the  person  in  question  was  her  husband. 
2084,geco,2-704,She  would  naturally  open  the  door  to  her  own  husband. 
2085,geco,2-705,Poirot  shook  his  head. 
2086,geco,2-706,Why  should  she? 
2087,geco,2-707,She  had  bolted  the  door  leading  into  his  room...a  most  unusual  proceeding  on  her  part...she  had  had  a  most  violent  quarrel  with  him  that  very  afternoon. 
2088,geco,2-708,"No,  he  was  the  last  person  she  would  admit. "
2089,geco,2-709,But  you  agree  with  me  that  the  door  must  have  been  opened  by  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  herself? 
2090,geco,2-710,There  is  another  possibility. 
2091,geco,2-711,"She  may  have  forgotten  to  bolt  the  door  into  the  passage  when  she  went  to  bed,  and  have  got  up  later,  towards  morning,  and  bolted  it  then. "
2092,geco,2-712,"Poirot,  is  that  seriously  your  opinion? "
2093,geco,2-713,"No,  I  do  not  say  it  is  so,  but  it  might  be. "
2094,geco,2-714,"Now,  to  turn  to  another  feature,  what  do  you  make  of  the  scrap  of  conversation  you  overheard  between  Mr.s.  Cavendish  and  her  mother-in-law? "
2095,geco,2-715,mother-in-law? 
2096,geco,2-716,"I  had  forgotten  that,  I  said  thoughtfully. "
2097,geco,2-717,That  is  as  enigmatical  as  ever. 
2098,geco,2-718,"It  seems  incredible  that  a  woman  like  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  proud  and  reticent  to  the  last  degree,  should  interfere  so  violently  in  what  was  certainly  not  her  affair. "
2099,geco,2-719,Precisely. 
2100,geco,2-720,It  was  an  astonishing  thing  for  a  woman  of  her  breeding  to  do. 
2101,geco,2-721,"It  is  certainly  curious,  I  agreed. "
2102,geco,2-722,"Still,  it  is  unimportant,  and  need  not  be  taken  into  account. "
2103,geco,2-723,A  groan  burst  from  Poirot. 
2104,geco,2-724,What  have  I  always  told  you? 
2105,geco,2-725,Everything  must  be  taken  into  account. 
2106,geco,2-726,If  the  fact  will  not  fit  the  theory...let  the  theory  go. 
2107,geco,2-727,"Well,  we  shall  see,  I  said,  nettled. "
2108,geco,2-728,"Yes,  we  shall  see. "
2109,geco,2-729,"We  had  reached  Leastways  Cottage,  and  Poirot  ushered  me  upstairs  to  his  own  room. "
2110,geco,2-730,He  offered  me  one  of  the  tiny  Russian  cigarettes  he  himself  occasionally  smoked. 
2111,geco,2-731,I  was  amused  to  notice  that  he  stowed  away  the  used  matches  most  carefully  in  a  little  china  pot. 
2112,geco,2-732,My  momentary  annoyance  vanished. 
2113,geco,2-733,Poirot  had  placed  our  two  chairs  in  front  of  the  open  window  which  commanded  a  view  of  the  village  street. 
2114,geco,2-734,The  fresh  air  blew  in  warm  and  pleasant. 
2115,geco,2-735,It  was  going  to  be  a  hot  day. 
2116,geco,2-736,Suddenly  my  attention  was  arrested  by  a  weedy  looking  young  man  rushing  down  the  street  at  a  great  pace. 
2117,geco,2-737,It  was  the  expression  on  his  face  that  was  extraordinary...a  curious  mingling  of  terror  and  agitation. 
2118,geco,2-738,"Look,  Poirot!  I  said. "
2119,geco,2-739,He  leant  forward. 
2120,geco,2-740,Tiens!  he  said. 
2121,geco,2-741,"It  is  Mr.  Mace,  from  the  chemist's  shop. "
2122,geco,2-742,He  is  coming  here. 
2123,geco,2-743,"The  young  man  came  to  a  halt  before  Leastways  Cottage,  and,  after  hesitating  a  moment,  pounded  vigorously  at  the  door. "
2124,geco,2-744,"A  little  minute,  cried  Poirot  from  the  window. "
2125,geco,2-745,I  come. 
2126,geco,2-746,"Motioning  to  me  to  follow  him,  he  ran  swiftly  down  the  stairs  and  opened  the  door. "
2127,geco,2-747,"Mr.  Mace  began  at  once. Oh, "
2128,geco,2-748,"Mr.  Poirot,  I'm  sorry  for  the  inconvenience,  but  I  heard  that  you'd  just  come  back  from  the  Hall? "
2129,geco,2-749,"Yes,  we  have. "
2130,geco,2-750,The  young  man  moistened  his  dry  lips. 
2131,geco,2-751,His  face  was  working  curiously. 
2132,geco,2-752,It's  all  over  the  village  about  old  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  dying  so  suddenly. 
2133,geco,2-753,They  do  say...  he  lowered  his  voice  cautiously... that  it's  poison? 
2134,geco,2-754,Poirot's  face  remained  quite  impassive. 
2135,geco,2-755,"Only  the  doctors  can  tell  us  that,  Mr.  Mace. "
2136,geco,2-756,"Yes,  exactly...of  course...... "
2137,geco,2-757,"The young  man  hesitated,  and  then  his  agitation  was  too  much  for  him. "
2138,geco,2-758,"He  clutched  Poirot  by  the  arm,  and  sank  his  voice  to  a  whisper:  Just  tell  me  this,  Mr.  Poirot,  it  isn't...it  isn't  strychnine,  is  it? "
2139,geco,2-759,I  hardly  heard  what  Poirot  replied. 
2140,geco,2-760,Something  evidently  of  a  non-committal  nature. 
2141,geco,2-761,"The  young  man  departed,  and  as  he  closed  the  door  Poirot's  eyes  met  mine. "
2142,geco,2-762,"Yes,  he  said,  nodding  gravely. "
2143,geco,2-763,He  will  have  evidence  to  give  at  the  inquest. 
2144,geco,2-764,We  went  slowly  upstairs  again. 
2145,geco,2-765,"I  was  opening  my  lips,  when  Poirot  stopped  me  with  a  gesture  of  his  hand. "
2146,geco,2-766,"Not  now,  not  now,  mon  ami. "
2147,geco,2-767,I  have  need  of  reflection. 
2148,geco,2-768,My  mind  is  in  some  disorder...which  is  not  well. 
2149,geco,2-769,"For  about  ten  minutes  he  sat  in  dead  silence,  perfectly  still,  except  for  several  expressive  motions  of  his  eyebrows,  and  all  the  time  his  eyes  grew  steadily  greener. "
2150,geco,2-770,At  last  he  heaved  a  deep  sigh. 
2151,geco,2-771,It  is  well. 
2152,geco,2-772,The  bad  moment  has  passed. 
2153,geco,2-773,Now  all  is  arranged  and  classified. 
2154,geco,2-774,One  must  never  permit  confusion. 
2155,geco,2-775,The  case  is  not  clear  yet...no. 
2156,geco,2-776,For  it  is  of  the  most  complicated! 
2157,geco,2-777,It  puzzles  me. 
2158,geco,2-778,"Me...,  Hercule  Poirot! "
2159,geco,2-779,There  are  two  facts  of  significance. 
2160,geco,2-780,And  what  are  they? 
2161,geco,2-781,The  first  is  the  state  of  the  weather  yesterday. 
2162,geco,2-782,That  is  very  important. 
2163,geco,2-783,But  it  was  a  glorious  day! 
2164,geco,2-784,I  interrupted. 
2165,geco,2-785,"Poirot,  you're  pulling  my  leg! "
2166,geco,2-786,Not  at  all. 
2167,geco,2-787,The  thermometer  registered  80 degrees  in  the  shade. 
2168,geco,2-788,"Do  not  forget  that,  my  friend. "
2169,geco,2-789,It  is  the  key  to  the  whole  riddle! 
2170,geco,2-790,And  the  second  point?  I  asked. 
2171,geco,2-791,"The  important  fact  that  Monsieur  Inglethorp  wears  very  peculiar  clothes,  has  a  black  beard,  and  uses  glasses. "
2172,geco,2-792,"Poirot,  I  cannot  believe  you  are  serious. "
2173,geco,2-793,"I  am  absolutely  serious,  my  friend. "
2174,geco,2-794,But  this  is  childish! 
2175,geco,2-795,"No,  it  is  very  momentous. "
2176,geco,2-796,And  supposing  the  Coroner's  jury  returns  a  verdict  of  Wilful  Murder  against  Alfred  Inglethorp. 
2177,geco,2-797,"What  becomes  of  your  theories,  then? "
2178,geco,2-798,They  would  not  be  shaken  because  twelve  stupid  men  had  happened  to  make  a  mistake! 
2179,geco,2-799,But  that  will  not  occur. 
2180,geco,2-800,"For  one  thing,  a  country  jury  is  not  anxious  to  take  responsibility  upon  itself,  and  Mr.  Inglethorp  stands  practically  in  the  position  of  local  squire. "
2181,geco,2-801,"Also,  he  added  placidly,  I  should  not  allow  it! "
2182,geco,2-802,You  would  not  allow  it? 
2183,geco,2-803,No. 
2184,geco,2-804,"I  looked  at  the  extraordinary  little  man,  divided  between  annoyance  and  amusement. "
2185,geco,2-805,He  was  so  tremendously  sure  of  himself. 
2186,geco,2-806,"As  though  he  read  my  thoughts,  he  nodded  gently. "
2187,geco,2-807,"Oh,  yes,  mon  ami,  I  would  do  what  I  say. "
2188,geco,2-808,He  got  up  and  laid  his  hand  on  my  shoulder. 
2189,geco,2-809,His  physiognomy  underwent  a  complete  change. 
2190,geco,2-810,Tears  came  into  his  eyes. 
2191,geco,2-811,"In  all  this,  you  see,  I  think  of  that  poor  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  who  is  dead. "
2192,geco,2-812,She  was  not  extravagantly  loved...no. 
2193,geco,2-813,But  she  was  very  good  to  us  Belgians...I  owe  her  a  debt. 
2194,geco,2-814,"I  endeavoured  to  interrupt,  but  Poirot  swept  on. "
2195,geco,2-815,"Let  me  tell  you  this,  Hastings. "
2196,geco,2-816,"She  would  never  forgive  me  if  I  let  Alfred  Inglethorp,  her  husband,  be  arrested  now...when  a  word  from  me  could  save  him! "
2197,geco,2-817,"In  the  interval  before  the  inquest,  Poirot  was  unfailing  in  his  activity. "
2198,geco,2-818,Twice  he  was  closeted  with  Mr.  Wells. 
2199,geco,2-819,He  also  took  long  walks  into  the  country. 
2200,geco,2-820,"I  rather  resented  his  not  taking  me  into  his  confidence,  the  more  so  as  I  could  not  in  the  least  guess  what  he  was  driving  at. "
2201,geco,2-821,"It  occurred  to  me  that  he  might  have  been  making  inquiries  at  Raikes's  farm;  so,  finding  him  out  when  I  called  at  Leastways  Cottage  on  Wednesday  evening,  I  walked  over  there  by  the  fields,  hoping  to  meet  him. "
2202,geco,2-822,"But  there  was  no  sign  of  him,  and  I  hesitated  to  go  right  up  to  the  farm  itself. "
2203,geco,2-823,"As  I  walked  away,  I  met  an  aged  rustic,  who  leered  at  me  cunningly. "
2204,geco,2-824,"You'm  from  the  Hall,  bain't  you?  he  asked. "
2205,geco,2-825,Yes. 
2206,geco,2-826,I'm  looking  for  a  friend  of  mine  whom  I  thought  might  have  walked  this  way. 
2207,geco,2-827,A  little  chap? 
2208,geco,2-828,As  waves  his  hands  when  he  talks? 
2209,geco,2-829,One  of  them  Belgies  from  the  village? 
2210,geco,2-830,"Yes,  I  said  eagerly. "
2211,geco,2-831,"He  has  been  here,  then? "
2212,geco,2-832,"Oh,  ay,  he's  been  here,  right  enough. "
2213,geco,2-833,More'n  once  too.Friend 
2214,geco,2-834,"of  yours,  is  he? "
2215,geco,2-835,"Ah,  you  gentlemen  from  the  Hall...you'n  a  pretty  lot! "
2216,geco,2-836,And  he  leered  more  jocosely  than  ever. 
2217,geco,2-837,"Why,  do  the  gentlemen  from  the  Hall  come  here  often?  I  asked,  as  carelessly  as  I  could. "
2218,geco,2-838,He  winked  at  me  knowingly. 
2219,geco,2-839,"One  does,  mister. "
2220,geco,2-840,"Naming  no  names,  mind. "
2221,geco,2-841,And  a  very  liberal  gentleman  too! 
2222,geco,2-842,"Oh,  thank  you,  sir,  I'm  sure. "
2223,geco,2-843,I  walked  on  sharply. 
2224,geco,2-844,"Evelyn  Howard  had  been  right  then,  and  I  experienced  a  sharp  twinge  of  disgust,  as  I  thought  of  Alfred  Inglethorp's  liberality  with  another  woman's  money. "
2225,geco,2-845,"Had  that  piquant  gipsy  face  been  at  the  bottom  of  the  crime,  or  was  it  the  baser  mainspring  of  money? "
2226,geco,2-846,Probably  a  judicious  mixture  of  both. 
2227,geco,2-847,"On  one  point,  Poirot  seemed  to  have  a  curious  obsession. "
2228,geco,2-848,He  once  or  twice  observed  to  me  that  he  thought  Dorcas  must  have  made  an  error  in  fixing  the  time  of  the  quarrel. 
2229,geco,2-849,"He  suggested  to  her  repeatedly  that  it  was  4.30, "
2230,geco,2-850,and  not  4 o'clock  when  she  had  heard  the  voices. 
2231,geco,2-851,But  Dorcas  was  unshaken. 
2232,geco,2-852,"Quite  an  hour,  or  even  more,  had  elapsed  between  the  time  when  she  had  heard  the  voices  and  5 o'clock,  when  she  had  taken  tea  to  her  mistress. "
2233,geco,2-853,The  inquest  was  held  on  Friday  at  the  Stylites  Arms  in  the  village. 
2234,geco,2-854,"Poirot  and  I  sat  together,  not  being  required  to  give  evidence. "
2235,geco,2-855,The  preliminaries  were  gone  through. 
2236,geco,2-856,"The  jury  viewed  the  body,  and  John  Cavendish  gave  evidence  of  identification. "
2237,geco,2-857,"Further  questioned,  he  described  his  awakening  in  the  early  hours  of  the  morning,  and  the  circumstances  of  his  mother's  death. "
2238,geco,2-858,The  medical  evidence  was  next  taken. 
2239,geco,2-859,"There  was  a  breathless  hush,  and  every  eye  was  fixed  on  the  famous  London  specialist,  who  was  known  to  be  one  of  the  greatest  authorities  of  the  day  on  the  subject  of  toxicology. "
2240,geco,2-860,"In  a  few  brief  words,  he  summed  up  the  result  of  the  post-mortem. "
2241,geco,2-861,"Shorn  of  its  medical  phraseology  and  technicalities,  it  amounted  to  the  fact  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  met  her  death  as  the  result  of  strychnine  poisoning. "
2242,geco,2-862,"Judging  from  the  quantity  recovered,  she  must  have  taken  not  less  than  three-quarters  of  a  grain  of  strychnine,  but  probably  one  grain  or  slightly  over. "
2243,geco,2-863,Is  it  possible  that  she  could  have  swallowed  the  poison  by  accident?  asked  the  Coroner. 
2244,geco,2-864,I  should  consider  it  very  unlikely. 
2245,geco,2-865,"Strychnine  is  not  used  for  domestic  purposes,  as  some  poisons  are,  and  there  are  restrictions  placed  on  its  sale. "
2246,geco,2-866,Does  anything  in  your  examination  lead  you  to  determine  how  the  poison  was  administered? 
2247,geco,2-867,No. 
2248,geco,2-868,"You  arrived  at  Styles  before  Dr  Wilkins,  I  believe? "
2249,geco,2-869,That  is  so. 
2250,geco,2-870,"The  motor  met  me  just  outside  the  lodge  gates,  and  I  hurried  there  as  fast  as  I  could. "
2251,geco,2-871,Will  you  relate  to  us  exactly  what  happened  next? 
2252,geco,2-872,I  entered  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room. 
2253,geco,2-873,She  was  at  that  moment  in  a  typical  tetanic  convulsion. 
2254,geco,2-874,"She  turned  towards  me,  and  gasped  out:  Alfred...Alfred......' "
2255,geco,2-875,Could the  strychnine  have  been  administered  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  after-dinner  coffee  which  was  taken  to  her  by  her  husband? 
2256,geco,2-876,"Possibly,  but  strychnine  is  a  fairly  rapid  drug  in  its  action. "
2257,geco,2-877,The  symptoms  appear  from  one  to  two  hours  after  it  has  been  swallowed. 
2258,geco,2-878,"It  is  retarded  under  certain  conditions,  none  of  which,  however,  appear  to  have  been  present  in  this  case. "
2259,geco,2-879,"I  presume  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  took  the  coffee  after  dinner  about  eight  o'clock,  whereas  the  symptoms  did  not  manifest  themselves  until  the  early  hours  of  the  morning,  which,  on  the  face  of  it,  points  to  the  drug  having  been  taken  much  later  in  the  evening. "
2260,geco,2-880,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  in  the  habit  of  drinking  a  cup  of  cocoa  in  the  middle  of  the  night. 
2261,geco,2-881,Could  the  strychnine  have  been  administered  in  that? 
2262,geco,2-882,"No,  I  myself  took  a  sample  of  the  cocoa  remaining  in  the  saucepan  and  had  it  analysed. "
2263,geco,2-883,There  was  no  strychnine  present. 
2264,geco,2-884,I  heard  Poirot  chuckle  softly  beside  me. 
2265,geco,2-885,How  did  you  know? 
2266,geco,2-886,I  whispered. 
2267,geco,2-887,Listen. 
2268,geco,2-888,I  should  say ...the  doctor  was  continuing... that  I  would  have  been  considerably  surprised  at  any  other  result. 
2269,geco,2-889,Why? 
2270,geco,2-890,Simply  because  strychnine  has  an  unusually  bitter  taste. 
2271,geco,2-891,"It  can  be  detected  in  a  solution  of  1 in  70,000,  and  can  only  be  disguised  by  some  strongly  flavoured  substance. "
2272,geco,2-892,cocoa  would  be  quite  powerless  to  mask  it. 
2273,geco,2-893,One  of  the  jury  wanted  to  know  if  the  same  objection  applied  to  coffee. 
2274,geco,2-894,No. 
2275,geco,2-895,Coffee  has  a  bitter  taste  of  its  own  which  would  probably  cover  the  taste  of  strychnine. 
2276,geco,2-896,"Then  you  consider  it  more  likely  that  the  drug  was  administered  in  the  coffee,  but  that  for  some  unknown  reason  its  action  was  delayed. "
2277,geco,2-897,"Yes,  but,  the  cup  being  completely  smashed,  there  is  no  possibility  of  analyzing  its  contents. "
2278,geco,2-898,This  concluded  Dr  Bauerstein's  evidence. 
2279,geco,2-899,Dr  Wilkins  corroborated  it  on  all  points. 
2280,geco,2-900,"Sounded  as  to  the  possibility  of  suicide,  he  repudiated  it  utterly. "
2281,geco,2-901,"The  deceased,  he  said,  suffered  from  a  weak  heart,  but  otherwise  enjoyed  perfect  health,  and  was  of  a  cheerful  and  well-balanced  disposition. "
2282,geco,2-902,She  would  be  one  of  the  last  people  to  take  her  own  life. 
2283,geco,2-903,Lawrence  Cavendish  was  next  called. 
2284,geco,2-904,"His  evidence  was  quite  unimportant,  being  a  mere  repetition  of  that  of  his  brother. "
2285,geco,2-905,"Just  as  he  was  about  to  step  down,  he  paused,  and  said  rather  hesitatingly:  I  should  like  to  make  a  suggestion  if  I  may? "
2286,geco,2-906,"He  glanced  deprecatingly  at  the  Coroner,  who  replied  briskly:  Certainly,  Mr.  Cavendish,  we  are  here  to  arrive  at  the  truth  of  this  matter,  and  welcome  anything  that  may  lead  to  further  elucidation. "
2287,geco,2-907,"It  is  just  an  idea  of  mine,  explained  Lawrence. "
2288,geco,2-908,"Of  course  I  may  be  quite  wrong,  but  it  still  seems  to  me  that  my  mother's  death  might  be  accounted  for  by  natural  means. "
2289,geco,2-909,"How  do  you  make  that  out,  Mr.  Cavendish? "
2290,geco,2-910,"My  mother,  at  the  time  of  her  death,  and  for  some  time  before  it,  was  taking  a  tonic  containing  strychnine. "
2291,geco,2-911,Ah!  said  the  Coroner. 
2292,geco,2-912,"The  jury  looked  up,  interested. "
2293,geco,2-913,"I  believe,  continued  Lawrence,  that  there  have  been  cases  where  the  cumulative  effect  of  a  drug,  administered  for  some  time,  has  ended  by  causing  death. "
2294,geco,2-914,"Also,  is  it  not  possible  that  she  may  have  taken  an  overdose  of  her  medicine  by  accident? "
2295,geco,2-915,This  is  the  first  we  have  heard  of  the  deceased  taking  strychnine  at  the  time  of  her  death. 
2296,geco,2-916,"We  are  much  obliged  to  you,  Mr.  Cavendish. "
2297,geco,2-917,Dr  Wilkins  was  recalled  and  ridiculed  the  idea. 
2298,geco,2-918,What  Mr.  Cavendish  suggests  is  quite  impossible. 
2299,geco,2-919,Any  doctor  would  tell  you  the  same. 
2300,geco,2-920,"Strychnine  is,  in  a  certain  sense,  a  cumulative  poison,  but  it  would  be  quite  impossible  for  it  to  result  in  sudden  death  in  this  way. "
2301,geco,2-921,There  would  have  to  be  a  long  period  of  chronic  symptoms  which  would  at  once  have  attracted  my  attention. 
2302,geco,2-922,The  whole  thing  is  absurd. 
2303,geco,2-923,And  the  second  suggestion? 
2304,geco,2-924,That  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  may  have  inadvertently  taken  an  overdose? 
2305,geco,2-925,"Three,  or  even  four  doses,  would  not  have  resulted  in  death. "
2306,geco,2-926,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  always  had  an  extra  large  amount  of  medicine  made  up  at  a  time,  as  she  dealt  with  Coot's,  the  Cash  Chemists  in  Tadminster. "
2307,geco,2-927,She  would  have  had  to  take  very  nearly  the  whole  bottle  to  account  for  the  amount  of  strychnine  found  at  the  post-mortem. 
2308,geco,2-928,Then  you  consider  that  we  may  dismiss  the  tonic  as  not  being  in  any  way  instrumental  in  causing  her  death? 
2309,geco,2-929,Certainly. 
2310,geco,2-930,The  supposition  is  ridiculous. 
2311,geco,2-931,The  same  juryman  who  had  interrupted  before  here  suggested  that  the  chemist  who  made  up  the  medicine  might  have  committed  an  error. 
2312,geco,2-932,"That,  of  course,  is  always  possible,  replied  the  doctor. "
2313,geco,2-933,"But  Dorcas,  who  was  the  next  witness  called,  dispelled  even  that  possibility. "
2314,geco,2-934,The  medicine  had  not  been  newly  made  up. 
2315,geco,2-935,"On  the  contrary,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  taken  the  last  dose  on  the  day  of  her  death. "
2316,geco,2-936,"So  the  question  of  the  tonic  was  finally  abandoned,  and  the  Coroner  proceeded  with  his  task. "
2317,geco,2-937,"Having  elicited  from  Dorcas  how  she  had  been  awakened  by  the  violent  ringing  of  her  mistress's  bell,  and  had  subsequently  roused  the  household,  he  passed  to  the  subject  of  the  quarrel  on  the  preceding  afternoon. "
2318,geco,2-938,"Dorcas's  evidence  on  this  point  was  substantially  what  Poirot  and  I  had  already  heard,  so  I  will  not  repeat  it  here. "
2319,geco,2-939,The  next  witness  was  Mary  Cavendish. 
2320,geco,2-940,"She  stood  very  upright,  and  spoke  in  a  low,  clear,  and  perfectly  composed  voice. "
2321,geco,2-941,"In  answer  to  the  Coroner's  question,  she  told  how,  her  alarm  clock  having  aroused  her  at  4.30 "
2322,geco,2-942,"as  usual,  she  was  dressing,  when  she  was  startled  by  the  sound  of  something  heavy  falling. "
2323,geco,2-943,That  would  have  been  the  table  by  the  bed? 
2324,geco,2-944,commented  the  Coroner. 
2325,geco,2-945,"I  opened  my  door,  continued  Mary,  and  listened. "
2326,geco,2-946,In  a  few  minutes  a  bell  rang  violently. 
2327,geco,2-947,"Dorcas  came  running  down  and  woke  my  husband,  and  we  all  went  to  my  mother-in-law's  mother-in-law's  room,  but  it  was  locked...... "
2328,geco,2-948,The Coroner  interrupted  her. 
2329,geco,2-949,I  really  do  not  think  we  need  trouble  you  further  on  that  point. 
2330,geco,2-950,We  know  all  that  can  be  known  of  the  subsequent  happenings. 
2331,geco,2-951,But  I  should  be  obliged  if  you  would  tell  us  all  you  overheard  of  the  quarrel  the  day  before. 
2332,geco,2-952,I? 
2333,geco,2-953,There  was  a  faint  insolence  in  her  voice. 
2334,geco,2-954,"She  raised  her  hand  and  adjusted  the  ruffle  of  lace  at  her  neck,  turning  her  head  a  little  as  she  did  so. "
2335,geco,2-955,And  quite  spontaneously  the  thought  flashed  across  my  mind:  She  is  gaining  time! 
2336,geco,2-956,Yes. 
2337,geco,2-957,"I  understand,  continued  the  Coroner  deliberately,  that  you  were  sitting  reading  on  the  bench  just  outside  the  long  window  of  the  boudoir. "
2338,geco,2-958,"That  is  so,  is  it  not? "
2339,geco,2-959,"This  was  news  to  me  and  glancing  sideways  at  Poirot,  I  fancied  that  it  was  news  to  him  as  well. "
2340,geco,2-960,"There  was  the  faintest  pause,  the  mere  hesitation  of  a  moment,  before  she  answered:  Yes,  that  is  so. "
2341,geco,2-961,"And  the  boudoir  window  was  open,  was  it  not? "
2342,geco,2-962,Surely  her  face  grew  a  little  paler  as  she  answered:  Yes. 
2343,geco,2-963,"Then  you  cannot  have  failed  to  hear  the  voices  inside,  especially  as  they  were  raised  in  anger. "
2344,geco,2-964,"In  fact,  they  would  be  more  audible  where  you  were  than  in  the  hall. "
2345,geco,2-965,Possibly. 
2346,geco,2-966,Will  you  repeat  to  us  what  you  overheard  of  the  quarrel? 
2347,geco,2-967,I  really  do  not  remember  hearing  anything. 
2348,geco,2-968,Do  you  mean  to  say  you  did  not  hear  voices? 
2349,geco,2-969,"Oh,  yes,  I  heard  the  voices,  but  I  did  not  hear  what  they  said. "
2350,geco,2-970,A  faint  spot  of  colour  came  into  her  cheek. 
2351,geco,2-971,I  am  not  in  the  habit  of  listening  to  private  conversations. 
2352,geco,2-972,The  Coroner  persisted. 
2353,geco,2-973,And  you  remember  nothing  at  all? 
2354,geco,2-974,"Nothing,  Mr.s.  Cavendish? "
2355,geco,2-975,Not  one  stray  word  or  phrase  to  make  you  realize  that  it  was  a  private  conversation? 
2356,geco,2-976,"She  paused,  and  seemed  to  reflect,  still  outwardly  as  calm  as  ever. "
2357,geco,2-977,Yes;  I  remember. 
2358,geco,2-978,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  said  something...I  do  not  remember  exactly  what...about  causing  scandal  between  husband  and  wife. 
2359,geco,2-979,Ah! 
2360,geco,2-980,the  Coroner  leant  back  satisfied. 
2361,geco,2-981,That  corresponds  with  what  Dorcas  heard. 
2362,geco,2-982,"But  excuse  me,  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  although  you  realized  it  was  a  private  conversation,  you  did  not  move  away? "
2363,geco,2-983,You  remained  where  you  were? 
2364,geco,2-984,I  caught  the  momentary  gleam  of  her  tawny  eyes  as  she  raised  them. 
2365,geco,2-985,"I  felt  certain  that  at  that  moment  she  would  willingly  have  torn  the  little  lawyer,  with  his  insinuations,  into  pieces,  but  she  replied  quietly  enough:  No. "
2366,geco,2-986,I  was  very  comfortable  where  I  was. 
2367,geco,2-987,I  fixed  my  mind  on  my  book. 
2368,geco,2-988,And  that  is  all  you  can  tell  us? 
2369,geco,2-989,That  is  all. 
2370,geco,2-990,"The  examination  was  over,  though  I  doubted  if  the  Coroner  was  entirely  satisfied  with  it. "
2371,geco,2-991,I  think  he  suspected  that  Mary  Cavendish  could  tell  more  if  she  chose. 
2372,geco,2-992,"Amy  Hill,  shop  assistant,  was  next  called,  and  deposed  to  having  sold  a  will  form  on  the  afternoon  of  the  17th  to  William  Earl,  under-gardener  at  Styles. "
2373,geco,2-993,"William  Earl  and  Manning  succeeded  her,  and  testified  to  witnessing  a  document. "
2374,geco,2-994,"Manning  fixed  the  time  at  about  4.30, "
2375,geco,2-995,William  was  of  the  opinion  that  it  was  rather  earlier. 
2376,geco,2-996,Cynthia  Murdoch  came  next. 
2377,geco,2-997,"She  had,  however,  little  to  tell. "
2378,geco,2-998,"She  had  known  nothing  of  the  tragedy,  until  awakened  by  Mr.s.  Cavendish. "
2379,geco,2-999,You  did  not  hear  the  table  fall? 
2380,geco,2-1000,No. 
2381,geco,2-1001,I  was  fast  asleep. 
2382,geco,2-1002,The  Coroner  smiled. 
2383,geco,2-1003,"A  good  conscience  makes  a  sound  sleeper,  he  observed. "
2384,geco,2-1004,"Thank  you,  Miss  Murdoch,  that  is  all. "
2385,geco,2-1005,Miss  Howard. 
2386,geco,2-1006,Miss  Howard  produced  the  letter  written  to  her  by  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  on  the  evening  of  the  17th. 
2387,geco,2-1007,"Poirot  and  I  had,  of  course  already  seen  it. "
2388,geco,2-1008,It  added  nothing  to  our  knowledge  of  the  tragedy. 
2389,geco,2-1009,"The  following  is  a  facsimile:  STYLES  COURT  ESSEX  hand  written  note:  July  17th  My  dear  Evelyn,  Can  we  not  bury  the  hachet? "
2390,geco,2-1010,"I  have  found  it  hard  to  forgive  the  things  you  said  against  my  dear  husband  but  I  am  an  old  woman  &  very  fond  of  you,  Yours  affectionately,  Emily  Inglethorpe  It  was  handed  to  the  jury  who  scrutinized  it  attentively. "
2391,geco,2-1011,"I  fear  it  does  not  help  us  much,  said  the  Coroner,  with  a  sigh. "
2392,geco,2-1012,There  is  no  mention  of  any  of  the  events  of  that  afternoon. 
2393,geco,2-1013,"Plain  as  a  pikestaff  to  me,  said  Miss  Howard  shortly. "
2394,geco,2-1014,It  shows  clearly  enough  that  my  poor  old  friend  had  just  found  out  she'd  been  made  a  fool  of! 
2395,geco,2-1015,"It  says  nothing  of  the  kind  in  the  letter,  the  Coroner  pointed  out. "
2396,geco,2-1016,"No,  because  Emily  never  could  bear  to  put  herself  in  the  wrong. "
2397,geco,2-1017,But  I  know  her. 
2398,geco,2-1018,She  wanted  me  back. 
2399,geco,2-1019,But  she  wasn't  going  to  own  that  I'd  been  right. 
2400,geco,2-1020,She  went  round  about. 
2401,geco,2-1021,Most  people  do. 
2402,geco,2-1022,Don't  believe  in  it  myself. 
2403,geco,2-1023,Mr.  Wells  smiled  faintly. 
2404,geco,2-1024,"So,  I  noticed,  did  several  of  the  jury. "
2405,geco,2-1025,Miss  Howard  was  obviously  quite  a  public  character. 
2406,geco,2-1026,"Anyway,  all  this  tomfoolery  is  a  great  waste  of  time,  continued  the  lady,  glancing  up  and  down  the  jury  disparagingly. "
2407,geco,2-1027,Talk...talk...talk! 
2408,geco,2-1028,When  all  the  time  we  know  perfectly  well...... 
2409,geco,2-1029,"The Coroner  interrupted  her  in  an  agony  of  apprehension:  Thank  you,  Miss  Howard,  that  is  all. "
2410,geco,2-1030,I  fancy  he  breathed  a  sigh  of  relief  when  she  complied. 
2411,geco,2-1031,Then  came  the  sensation  of  the  day. 
2412,geco,2-1032,"The  Coroner  called  Albert  Mace,  chemist's  assistant. "
2413,geco,2-1033,It  was  our  agitated  young  man  of  the  pale  face. 
2414,geco,2-1034,"In  answer  to  the  Coroner's  questions,  he  explained  that  he  was  a  qualified  pharmacist,  but  had  only  recently  come  to  this  particular  shop,  as  the  assistant  formerly  there  had  just  been  called  up  for  the  army. "
2415,geco,2-1035,"These  preliminaries  completed,  the  Coroner  proceeded  to  business. "
2416,geco,2-1036,"Mr.  Mace,  have  you  lately  sold  strychnine  to  any  unauthorized  person? "
2417,geco,2-1037,"Yes,  sir. "
2418,geco,2-1038,When  was  this? 
2419,geco,2-1039,Last  Monday  night. 
2420,geco,2-1040,Monday? 
2421,geco,2-1041,Not  Tuesday? 
2422,geco,2-1042,"No,  sir,  Monday,  the  16th. "
2423,geco,2-1043,Will  you  tell  us  to  whom  you  sold  it? 
2424,geco,2-1044,You  could  have  heard  a  pin  drop. 
2425,geco,2-1045,"Yes,  sir. "
2426,geco,2-1046,It  was  to  Mr.  Inglethorp. 
2427,geco,2-1047,"Every  eye  turned  simultaneously  to  where  Alfred  Inglethorp  was  sitting,  impassive  and  wooden. "
2428,geco,2-1048,"He  started  slightly,  as  the  damning  words  fell  from  the  young  man's  lips. "
2429,geco,2-1049,"I  half  thought  he  was  going  to  rise  from  his  chair,  but  he  remained  seated,  although  a  remarkably  well  acted  expression  of  astonishment  rose  on  his  face. "
2430,geco,2-1050,You  are  sure  of  what  you  say?  asked  the  Coroner  sternly. 
2431,geco,2-1051,"Quite  sure,  sir. "
2432,geco,2-1052,Are  you  in  the  habit  of  selling  strychnine  indiscriminately  over  the  counter? 
2433,geco,2-1053,The  wretched  young  man  wilted  visibly  under  the  Coroner's  frown. 
2434,geco,2-1054,"Oh,  no,  sir...of  sir...of  course  not. "
2435,geco,2-1055,"But,  seeing  it  was  Mr.  Inglethorp  of  the  Hall,  I  thought  there  was  no  harm  in  it. "
2436,geco,2-1056,He  said  it  was  to  poison  a  dog. 
2437,geco,2-1057,Inwardly  I  sympathized. 
2438,geco,2-1058,It  was  only  human  nature  to  endeavour  to  please  'The  Hall'...especially  when  it  might  result  in  custom  being  transferred  from  Coot's  to  the  local  establishment. 
2439,geco,2-1059,Is  it  not  customary  for  anyone  purchasing  poison  to  sign  a  book? 
2440,geco,2-1060,"Yes,  sir,  Mr.  Inglethorp  did  so. "
2441,geco,2-1061,Have  you  got  the  book  here? 
2442,geco,2-1062,"Yes,  sir. "
2443,geco,2-1063,"It  was  produced;  and,  with  a  few  words  of  stern  censure,  the  Coroner  dismissed  the  wretched  Mr.  Mace. "
2444,geco,2-1064,"Then,  amidst  a  breathless  silence,  Alfred  Inglethorp  was  called. "
2445,geco,2-1065,"Did  he  realize,  I  wondered,  how  closely  the  halter  was  being  drawn  around  his  neck? "
2446,geco,2-1066,The  Coroner  went  straight  to  the  point. 
2447,geco,2-1067,"On  Monday  evening  last,  did  you  purchase  strychnine  for  the  purpose  of  poisoning  a  dog? "
2448,geco,2-1068,"Inglethorp  replied  with  perfect  calmness:  No,  I  did  not. "
2449,geco,2-1069,"There  is  no  dog  at  Styles,  except  an  outdoor  sheepdog,  which  is  in  perfect  health. "
2450,geco,2-1070,You  deny  absolutely  having  purchased  strychnine  from  Albert  Mace  on  Monday  last? 
2451,geco,2-1071,I  do. 
2452,geco,2-1072,Do  you  also  deny  this? 
2453,geco,2-1073,The  Coroner  handed  him  the  register  in  which  his  signature  was  inscribed. 
2454,geco,2-1074,Certainly  I  do. 
2455,geco,2-1075,The  hand-writing  is  quite  different  from  mine. 
2456,geco,2-1076,I  will  show  you. 
2457,geco,2-1077,"He  took  an  old  envelope  out  of  his  pocket,  and  wrote  his  name  on  it,  handing  it  to  the  jury. "
2458,geco,2-1078,It  was  certainly  utterly  dissimilar. 
2459,geco,2-1079,Then  what  is  your  explanation  of  Mr.  Mace's  statement? 
2460,geco,2-1080,Alfred  Inglethorp  replied  imperturbably:  Mr.  Mace  must  have  been  mistaken. 
2461,geco,2-1081,"The  Coroner  hesitated  for  a  moment,  and  then  said:  Mr.  Inglethorp,  as  a  mere  matter  of  form,  would  you  mind  telling  us  where  you  were  on  the  evening  of  Monday,  July  16th? "
2462,geco,2-1082,Really...I  can't  remember. 
2463,geco,2-1083,"That  is  absurd,  Mr.  Inglethorp,  said  the  Coroner  sharply. "
2464,geco,2-1084,Think  again. 
2465,geco,2-1085,Inglethorp  shook  his  head. 
2466,geco,2-1086,I  cannot  tell  you. 
2467,geco,2-1087,I  have  an  idea  that  I  was  out  walking. 
2468,geco,2-1088,In  what  direction? 
2469,geco,2-1089,I  really  can't  remember. 
2470,geco,2-1090,The  Coroner's  face  grew  graver. 
2471,geco,2-1091,Were  you  in  company  with  anyone? 
2472,geco,2-1092,No. 
2473,geco,2-1093,Did  you  meet  anyone  on  your  walk? 
2474,geco,2-1094,No. 
2475,geco,2-1095,"That  is  a  pity,  said  the  Coroner  dryly. "
2476,geco,2-1096,I  am  to  take  it  then  that  you  decline  to  say  where  you  were  at  the  time  that  Mr.  Mace  positively  recognized  you  as  entering  the  shop  to  purchase  strychnine? 
2477,geco,2-1097,"If  you  like  to  take  it  that  way,  yes. "
2478,geco,2-1098,"Be  careful,  Mr.  Inglethorp. "
2479,geco,2-1099,Poirot  was  fidgeting  nervously. 
2480,geco,2-1100,Sacre! 
2481,geco,2-1101,he  murmured. 
2482,geco,2-1102,Does  this  imbecile  of  a  man  want  to  be  arrested? 
2483,geco,2-1103,Inglethorp  was  indeed  creating  a  bad  impression. 
2484,geco,2-1104,His  futile  denials  would  not  have  convinced  a  child. 
2485,geco,2-1105,"The  Coroner,  however,  passed  briskly  to  the  next  point,  and  Poirot  drew  a  deep  breath  of  relief. "
2486,geco,2-1106,You  had  a  discussion  with  your  wife  on  Tuesday  afternoon? 
2487,geco,2-1107,"Pardon  me,  interrupted  Alfred  Inglethorp,  you  have  been  misinformed. "
2488,geco,2-1108,I  had  no  quarrel  with  my  dear  wife. 
2489,geco,2-1109,The  whole  story  is  absolutely  untrue. 
2490,geco,2-1110,I  was  absent  from  the  house  the  entire  afternoon. 
2491,geco,2-1111,Have  you  anyone  who  can  testify  to  that? 
2492,geco,2-1112,"You  have  my  word,  said  Inglethorp  haughtily. "
2493,geco,2-1113,The  Coroner  did  not  trouble  to  reply. 
2494,geco,2-1114,There  are  two  witnesses  who  will  swear  to  having  heard  your  disagreement  with  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. 
2495,geco,2-1115,Those  witnesses  were  mistaken. 
2496,geco,2-1116,I  was  puzzled. 
2497,geco,2-1117,The  man  spoke  with  such  quiet  assurance  that  I  was  staggered. 
2498,geco,2-1118,I  looked  at  Poirot. 
2499,geco,2-1119,There  was  an  expression  of  exultation  on  his  face  which  I  could  not  understand. 
2500,geco,2-1120,Was  he  at  last  convinced  of  Alfred  Inglethorp's  guilt? 
2501,geco,2-1121,"Mr.  Inglethorp,  said  the  Coroner,  you  have  heard  your  wife's  dying  words  repeated  here. "
2502,geco,2-1122,Can  you  explain  them  in  any  way? 
2503,geco,2-1123,Certainly  I  can. 
2504,geco,2-1124,You  can? 
2505,geco,2-1125,It  seems  to  me  very  simple. 
2506,geco,2-1126,The  room  was  dimly  lighted. 
2507,geco,2-1127,"Dr  Bauerstein  is  much  of  my  height  and  build,  and,  like  me,  wears  a  beard. "
2508,geco,2-1128,"In  the  dim  light,  and  suffering  as  she  was,  my  poor  wife  mistook  him  for  me. "
2509,geco,2-1129,Ah! 
2510,geco,2-1130,murmured  Poirot  to  himself. 
2511,geco,2-1131,"But  it  is  an  idea,  that! "
2512,geco,2-1132,You  think  it  is  true? 
2513,geco,2-1133,I  whispered. 
2514,geco,2-1134,I  do  not  say  that. 
2515,geco,2-1135,But  it  is  truly  an  ingenious  supposition. 
2516,geco,2-1136,"You  read  my  wife's  last  words  as  an  accusation ...Inglethorp  was  continuing... they  were,  on  the  contrary,  an  appeal  to  me. "
2517,geco,2-1137,"The  Coroner  reflected  a  moment,  then  he  said:  I  believe,  Mr.  Inglethorp,  that  you  yourself  poured  out  the  coffee,  and  took  it  to  your  wife  that  evening? "
2518,geco,2-1138,"I  poured  it  out,  yes. "
2519,geco,2-1139,But  I  did  not  take  it  to  her. 
2520,geco,2-1140,"I  meant  to  do  so,  but  I  was  told  that  a  friend  was  at  the  hall  door,  so  I  laid  down  the  coffee  on  the  hall  table. "
2521,geco,2-1141,"When  I  came  through  the  hall  again  a  few  minutes  later,  it  was  gone. "
2522,geco,2-1142,"This  statement  might,  or  might  not,  be  true,  but  it  did  not  seem  to  me  to  improve  matters  much  for  Inglethorp. "
2523,geco,2-1143,"In  any  case,  he  had  had  ample  time  to  introduce  the  poison. "
2524,geco,2-1144,"At  that  point,  Poirot  nudged  me  gently,  indicating  two  men  who  were  sitting  together  near  the  door. "
2525,geco,2-1145,"One  was  a  little,  sharp,  dark,  ferret-faced  man,  the  other  was  tall  and  fair. "
2526,geco,2-1146,I  questioned  Poirot  mutely. 
2527,geco,2-1147,He  put  his  lips  to  my  ear. 
2528,geco,2-1148,Do  you  know  who  that  little  man  is? 
2529,geco,2-1149,I  shook  my  head. 
2530,geco,2-1150,That  is  Detective  Inspector  James  Japp  of  Scotland  Yard...Jimmy  Japp. 
2531,geco,2-1151,The  other  man  is  from  Scotland  Yard  too. 
2532,geco,2-1152,"Things  are  moving  quickly,  my  friend. "
2533,geco,2-1153,I  stared  at  the  two  men  intently. 
2534,geco,2-1154,There  was  certainly  nothing  of  the  policeman  about  them. 
2535,geco,2-1155,I  should  never  have  suspected  them  of  being  official  personages. 
2536,geco,2-1156,"I  was  still  staring,  when  I  was  startled  and  recalled  by  the  verdict  being  given:  Wilful  Murder  against  some  person  or  persons  unknown. "
2537,geco,2-1157,"As  we  came  out  of  the  Stylites  Arms,  Poirot  drew  me  aside  by  a  gentle  pressure  of  the  arm. "
2538,geco,2-1158,I  understood  his  object. 
2539,geco,2-1159,He  was  waiting  for  the  Scotland  Yard  men. 
2540,geco,2-1160,"In  a  few  moments,  they  emerged,  and  Poirot  at  once  stepped  forward,  and  accosted  the  shorter  of  the  two. "
2541,geco,2-1161,"I  fear  you  do  not  remember  me,  Inspector  Japp. "
2542,geco,2-1162,"Why,  if  it  isn't  Mr.  Poirot!  cried  the  Inspector. "
2543,geco,2-1163,He  turned  to  the  other  man. 
2544,geco,2-1164,You've  heard  me  speak  of  Mr.  Poirot? 
2545,geco,2-1165,"It  was  in  1904 he  and  I  worked  together...the  Abercrombie  forgery  case...you  remember,  he  was  run  down  in  Brussels. "
2546,geco,2-1166,"Ah,  those  were  great  days,  moosier. "
2547,geco,2-1167,"Then,  do  you  remember  'Baron'  Altara? "
2548,geco,2-1168,There  was  a  pretty  rogue  for  you! 
2549,geco,2-1169,He  eluded  the  clutches  of  half  the  police  in  Europe. 
2550,geco,2-1170,But  we  nailed  him  in  Antwerp...thanks  to  Mr.  Poirot  here. 
2551,geco,2-1171,"As  these  friendly  reminiscences  were  being  indulged  in,  I  drew  nearer,  and  was  introduced  to  Detective-Inspector  Japp,  who,  in  his  turn,  introduced  us  both  to  his  companion,  Superintendent  Summerhaye. "
2552,geco,2-1172,"I  need  hardly  ask  what  you  are  doing  here,  gentlemen,  remarked  Poirot. "
2553,geco,2-1173,Japp  closed  one  eye  knowingly. 
2554,geco,2-1174,"No,  indeed. "
2555,geco,2-1175,Pretty  clear  case  I  should  say. 
2556,geco,2-1176,But  Poirot  answered  gravely:  There  I  differ  from  you. 
2557,geco,2-1177,"Oh,  come!  said  Summerhaye,  opening  his  lips  for  the  first  time. "
2558,geco,2-1178,Surely  the  whole  thing  is  clear  as  daylight. 
2559,geco,2-1179,The  man's  caught  red-handed. 
2560,geco,2-1180,How  he  could  be  such  a  fool  beats  me! 
2561,geco,2-1181,But  Japp  was  looking  attentively  at  Poirot. 
2562,geco,2-1182,"Hold  your  fire,  Summerhaye,  he  remarked  jocularly. "
2563,geco,2-1183,Me  and  Moosier  here  have  met  before...and  there's  no  man's  judgment  I'd  sooner  take  than  his. 
2564,geco,2-1184,"If  I'm  not  greatly  mistaken,  he's  got  something  up  his  sleeve. "
2565,geco,2-1185,"Isn't  that  so,  moosier? "
2566,geco,2-1186,Poirot  smiled. 
2567,geco,2-1187,I  have  drawn  certain  conclusions...yes. 
2568,geco,2-1188,"Summerhaye  was  still  looking  rather  sceptical,  but  Japp  continued  his  scrutiny  of  Poirot. "
2569,geco,2-1189,"It's  this  way,  he  said,  so  far,  we've  only  seen  the  case  from  the  outside. "
2570,geco,2-1190,"That's  where  the  Yard's  at  a  disadvantage  in  a  case  of  this  kind,  where  the  murder's  only  out,  so  to  speak,  after  the  inquest. "
2571,geco,2-1191,"A  lot  depends  on  being  on  the  spot  first  thing,  and  that's  where  Mr.  Poirot's  had  the  start  of  us. "
2572,geco,2-1192,"We  shouldn't  have  been  here  as  soon  as  this  even,  if  it  hadn't  been  for  the  fact  that  there  was  a  smart  doctor  on  the  spot,  who  gave  us  the  tip  through  the  Coroner. "
2573,geco,2-1193,"But  you've  been  on  the  spot  from  the  first,  and  you  may  have  picked  up  some  little  hints. "
2574,geco,2-1194,"From  the  evidence  at  the  inquest,  Mr.  Inglethorp  murdered  his  wife  as  sure  as  I  stand  here,  and  if  anyone  but  you  hinted  the  contrary  I'd  laugh  in  his  face. "
2575,geco,2-1195,I  must  say  I  was  surprised  the  jury  didn't  bring  it  in  Wilful  Murder  against  him  right  off. 
2576,geco,2-1196,"I  think  they  would  have,  if  it  hadn't  been  for  the  Coroner...he  seemed  to  be  holding  them  back. "
2577,geco,2-1197,"Perhaps,  though,  you  have  a  warrant  for  his  arrest  in  your  pocket  now,  suggested  Poirot. "
2578,geco,2-1198,A  kind  of  wooden  shutter  of  officialdom  came  down  from  Japp's  expressive  countenance. 
2579,geco,2-1199,"Perhaps  I  have,  and  perhaps  I  haven't,  he  remarked  dryly. "
2580,geco,2-1200,Poirot  looked  at  him  thoughtfully. 
2581,geco,2-1201,"I  am  very  anxious,  Messieurs,  that  he  should  not  be  arrested. "
2582,geco,2-1202,"I  dare  say,  observed  Summerhaye  sarcastically. "
2583,geco,2-1203,Japp  was  regarding  Poirot  with  comical  perplexity. 
2584,geco,2-1204,"Can't  you  go  a  little  further,  Mr.  Poirot? "
2585,geco,2-1205,A  wink's  as  good  as  a  nod...from  you. 
2586,geco,2-1206,"You've  been  on  the  spot...and  the  Yard  doesn't  want  to  make  any  mistakes,  you  know. "
2587,geco,2-1207,Poirot  nodded  gravely. 
2588,geco,2-1208,That  is  exactly  what  I  thought. 
2589,geco,2-1209,"Well,  I  will  tell  you  this. "
2590,geco,2-1210,Use  your  warrant:  Arrest  Mr.  Inglethorp. 
2591,geco,2-1211,But  it  will  bring  you  no  kudos...the  kudos...the  case  against  him  will  be  dismissed  at  once! 
2592,geco,2-1212,Comme  ca! 
2593,geco,2-1213,And  he  snapped  his  fingers  expressively. 
2594,geco,2-1214,"Japp's  face  grew  grave,  though  Summerhaye  gave  an  incredulous  snort. "
2595,geco,2-1215,"As  for  me,  I  was  literally  dumb  with  astonishment. "
2596,geco,2-1216,I  could  only  conclude  that  Poirot  was  mad. 
2597,geco,2-1217,"Japp  had  taken  out  a  handkerchief,  and  was  gently  dabbing  his  brow. "
2598,geco,2-1218,"I  daren't  do  it,  Mr.  Poirot. "
2599,geco,2-1219,"I'd  take  your  word,  but  there's  others  over  me  who'll  be  asking  what  the  devil  I  mean  by  it. "
2600,geco,2-1220,Can't  you  give  me  a  little  more  to  go  on? 
2601,geco,2-1221,Poirot  reflected  a  moment. 
2602,geco,2-1222,"It  can  be  done,  he  said  at  last. "
2603,geco,2-1223,I  admit  I  do  not  wish  it. 
2604,geco,2-1224,It  forces  my  hand. 
2605,geco,2-1225,"I  would  have  preferred  to  work  in  the  dark  just  for  the  present,  but  what  you  say  is  very  just...the  word  of  a  Belgian  policeman,  whose  day  is  past,  is  not  enough! "
2606,geco,2-1226,And  Alfred  Inglethorp  must  not  be  arrested. 
2607,geco,2-1227,"That  I  have  sworn,  as  my  friend  Hastings  here  knows. "
2608,geco,2-1228,"See,  then,  my  good  Japp,  you  go  at  once  to  Styles? "
2609,geco,2-1229,"Well,  in  about  half  an  hour. "
2610,geco,2-1230,We're  seeing  the  Coroner  and  the  doctor  first. 
2611,geco,2-1231,Good. 
2612,geco,2-1232,Call  for  me  in  passing...the  last  house  in  the  village. 
2613,geco,2-1233,I  will  go  with  you. 
2614,geco,2-1234,"At  Styles,  Mr.  Inglethorp  will  give  you,  or  if  he  refuses...as  is  probable...I  probable...I  will  give  you  such  proofs  that  shall  satisfy  you  that  the  case  against  him  could  not  possibly  be  sustained. "
2615,geco,2-1235,Is  that  a  bargain? 
2616,geco,2-1236,"That's  a  bargain,  said  Japp  heartily. "
2617,geco,2-1237,"And,  on  behalf  of  the  Yard,  I'm  much  obliged  to  you,  though  I'm  bound  to  confess  I  can't  at  present  see  the  faintest  possible  loop-hole  in  the  evidence,  but  you  always  were  a  marvel! "
2618,geco,2-1238,"So  long,  then,  moosier. "
2619,geco,2-1239,"The  two  detectives  strode  away,  Summerhaye  with  an  incredulous  grin  on  his  face. "
2620,geco,2-1240,"Well,  my  friend,  cried  Poirot,  before  I  could  get  in  a  word,  what  do  you  think? "
2621,geco,2-1241,Mon  Dieu! 
2622,geco,2-1242,I  had  some  warm  moments  in  that  court;  I  did  not  figure  to  myself  that  the  man  would  be  so  pig-headed  as  to  refuse  to  say  anything  at  all. 
2623,geco,2-1243,"Decidedly,  it  was  the  policy  of  an  imbecile. "
2624,geco,2-1244,H'm! 
2625,geco,2-1245,"There  are  other  explanations  besides  that  of  imbecility,  I  remarked. "
2626,geco,2-1246,"For,  if  the  case  against  him  is  true,  how  could  he  defend  himself  except  by  silence? "
2627,geco,2-1247,"Why,  in  a  thousand  ingenious  ways,  cried  Poirot. "
2628,geco,2-1248,"See;  say  that  it  is  I  who  have  committed  this  murder,  I  can  think  of  seven  most  plausible  stories! "
2629,geco,2-1249,Far  more  convincing  than  Mr.  Inglethorp's  stony  denials! 
2630,geco,2-1250,I  could  not  help  laughing. 
2631,geco,2-1251,"My  dear  Poirot,  I  am  sure  you  are  capable  of  thinking  of  seventy! "
2632,geco,2-1252,"But,  seriously,  in  spite  of  what  I  heard  you  say  to  the  detectives,  you  surely  cannot  still  believe  in  the  possibility  of  Alfred  Inglethorp's  innocence? "
2633,geco,2-1253,Why  not  now  as  much  as  before? 
2634,geco,2-1254,Nothing  has  changed. 
2635,geco,2-1255,But  the  evidence  is  so  conclusive. 
2636,geco,2-1256,"Yes,  too  conclusive. "
2637,geco,2-1257,"We  turned  in  at  the  gate  of  Leastways  Cottage,  and  proceeded  up  the  now  familiar  stairs. "
2638,geco,2-1258,"Yes,  yes,  too  conclusive,  continued  Poirot,  almost  to  himself. "
2639,geco,2-1259,Real  evidence  is  usually  vague  and  unsatisfactory. 
2640,geco,2-1260,It  has  to  be  examined...sifted. 
2641,geco,2-1261,But  here  the  whole  thing  is  cut  and  dried. 
2642,geco,2-1262,"No,  my  friend,  this  evidence  has  been  very  cleverly  manufactured...so  cleverly  that  it  has  defeated  its  own  ends. "
2643,geco,2-1263,How  do  you  make  that  out? 
2644,geco,2-1264,"Because,  so  long  as  the  evidence  against  him  was  vague  and  intangible,  it  was  very  hard  to  disprove. "
2645,geco,2-1265,"But,  in  his  anxiety,  the  criminal  has  drawn  the  net  so  closely  that  one  cut  will  set  Inglethorp  free. "
2646,geco,2-1266,I  was  silent. 
2647,geco,2-1267,"And  in  a  minute  or  two,  Poirot  continued:  Let  us  look  at  the  matter  like  this. "
2648,geco,2-1268,"Here  is  a  man,  let  us  say,  who  sets  out  to  poison  his  wife. "
2649,geco,2-1269,He  has  lived  by  his  wits  as  the  saying  goes. 
2650,geco,2-1270,"Presumably,  therefore,  he  has  some  wits. "
2651,geco,2-1271,He  is  not  altogether  a  fool. 
2652,geco,2-1272,"Well,  how  does  he  set  about  it? "
2653,geco,2-1273,"He  goes  boldly  to  the  village  chemist's  and  purchases  strychnine  under  his  own  name,  with  a  trumped  up  story  about  a  dog  which  is  bound  to  be  proved  absurd. "
2654,geco,2-1274,He  does  not  employ  the  poison  that  night. 
2655,geco,2-1275,"No,  he  waits  until  he  has  had  a  violent  quarrel  with  her,  of  which  the  whole  household  is  cognisant,  and  which  naturally  directs  their  suspicions  upon  him. "
2656,geco,2-1276,"He  prepares  no  defence...no  shadow  of  an  alibi,  yet  he  knows  the  chemist's  assistant  must  necessarily  come  forward  with  the  facts. "
2657,geco,2-1277,Bah! 
2658,geco,2-1278,do  not  ask  me  to  believe  that  any  man  could  be  so  idiotic! 
2659,geco,2-1279,"Only  a  lunatic,  who  wished  to  commit  suicide  by  causing  himself  to  be  hanged,  would  act  so! "
2660,geco,2-1280,Still...I  do  not  see...  I  began. 
2661,geco,2-1281,Neither  do  I  see. 
2662,geco,2-1282,"I  tell  you,  mon  ami,  it  puzzles  me. "
2663,geco,2-1283,Me...Hercule  Poirot! 
2664,geco,2-1284,"But  if  you  believe  him  innocent,  how  do  you  explain  his  buying  the  strychnine? "
2665,geco,2-1285,Very  simply. 
2666,geco,2-1286,He  did  not  buy  it. 
2667,geco,2-1287,But  Mace  recognized  him! 
2668,geco,2-1288,"I  beg  your  pardon,  he  saw  a  man  with  a  black  beard  like  Mr.  Inglethorp's,  and  wearing  glasses  like  Mr.  Inglethorp,  and  dressed  in  Mr.  Inglethorp's  rather  noticeable  clothes. "
2669,geco,2-1289,"He  could  not  recognize  a  man  whom  he  had  probably  only  seen  in  the  distance,  since,  you  remember,  he  himself  had  only  been  in  the  village  a  fortnight,  and  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  dealt  principally  with  Coot's  in  Tadminster. "
2670,geco,2-1290,Then  you  think...... 
2671,geco,2-1291,"Mon ami,  do  you  remember  the  two  points  I  laid  stress  upon? "
2672,geco,2-1292,"Leave  the  first  one  for  the  moment,  what  was  the  second? "
2673,geco,2-1293,"The  important  fact  that  Alfred  Inglethorp  wears  peculiar  clothes,  has  a  black  beard,  and  uses  glasses,  I  quoted. "
2674,geco,2-1294,Exactly. 
2675,geco,2-1295,Now  suppose  anyone  wished  to  pass  himself  off  as  John  or  Lawrence  Cavendish. 
2676,geco,2-1296,Would  it  be  easy? 
2677,geco,2-1297,"No,  I  said  thoughtfully. "
2678,geco,2-1298,Of  course  an  actor......  But  Poirot  cut  me  short  ruthlessly. 
2679,geco,2-1299,And  why  would  it  not  be  easy? 
2680,geco,2-1300,"I  will  tell  you,  my  friend:  Because  they  are  both  clean-shaven  men. "
2681,geco,2-1301,"To  make  up  successfully  as  one  of  these  two  in  broad  daylight,  it  would  need  an  actor  of  genius,  and  a  certain  initial  facial  resemblance. "
2682,geco,2-1302,"But  in  the  case  of  Alfred  Inglethorp,  all  that  is  changed. "
2683,geco,2-1303,"His  clothes,  his  beard,  the  glasses  which  hide  his  eyes...those  are  the  salient  points  about  his  personal  appearance. "
2684,geco,2-1304,"Now,  what  is  the  first  instinct  of  the  criminal? "
2685,geco,2-1305,"To  divert  suspicion  from  himself,  is  it  not  so? "
2686,geco,2-1306,And  how  can  he  best  do  that? 
2687,geco,2-1307,By  throwing  it  on  some  one  else. 
2688,geco,2-1308,"In  this  instance,  there  was  a  man  ready  to  his  hand. "
2689,geco,2-1309,Everybody  was  predisposed  to  believe  in  Mr.  Inglethorp's  guilt. 
2690,geco,2-1310,"It  was  a  foregone  conclusion  that  he  would  be  suspected;  but,  to  make  it  a  sure  thing  there  must  be  tangible  proof...such  as  the  actual  buying  of  the  poison,  and  that,  with  a  man  of  the  peculiar  appearance  of  Mr.  Inglethorp,  was  not  difficult. "
2691,geco,2-1311,"Remember,  this  young  Mace  had  never  actually  spoken  to  Mr.  Inglethorp. "
2692,geco,2-1312,"How  should  he  doubt  that  the  man  in  his  clothes,  with  his  beard  and  his  glasses,  was  not  Alfred  Inglethorp? "
2693,geco,2-1313,"It  may  be  so,  I  said,  fascinated  by  Poirot's  eloquence. "
2694,geco,2-1314,"But,  if  that  was  the  case,  why  does  he  not  say  where  he  was  at  six  o'clock  on  Monday  evening? "
2695,geco,2-1315,"Ah,  why  indeed?  said  Poirot,  calming  down. "
2696,geco,2-1316,"If  he  were  arrested,  he  probably  would  speak,  but  I  do  not  want  it  to  come  to  that. "
2697,geco,2-1317,I  must  make  him  see  the  gravity  of  his  position. 
2698,geco,2-1318,"There  is,  of  course,  something  discreditable  behind  his  silence. "
2699,geco,2-1319,"If  he  did  not  murder  his  wife,  he  is,  nevertheless,  a  scoundrel,  and  has  something  of  his  own  to  conceal,  quite  apart  from  the  murder. "
2700,geco,2-1320,What  can  it  be? 
2701,geco,2-1321,"I  mused,  won  over  to  Poirot's  views  for  the  moment,  although  still  retaining  a  faint  conviction  that  the  obvious  deduction  was  the  correct  one. "
2702,geco,2-1322,"Can  you  not  guess?  asked  Poirot,  smiling. "
2703,geco,2-1323,"No,  can  you? "
2704,geco,2-1324,"Oh,  yes,  I  had  a  little  idea  sometime  ago...and  it  has  turned  out  to  be  correct. "
2705,geco,2-1325,"You  never  told  me,  I  said  reproachfully. "
2706,geco,2-1326,Poirot  spread  out  his  hands  apologetically. 
2707,geco,2-1327,"Pardon  me,  mon  ami,  you  were  not  precisely  sympathique. "
2708,geco,2-1328,He  turned  to  me  earnestly. 
2709,geco,2-1329,Tell  me...you  see  now  that  he  must  not  be  arrested? 
2710,geco,2-1330,"Perhaps,  I  said  doubtfully,  for  I  was  really  quite  indifferent  to  the  fate  of  Alfred  Inglethorp,  and  thought  that  a  good  fright  would  do  him  no  harm. "
2711,geco,2-1331,"Poirot,  who  was  watching  me  intently,  gave  a  sigh. "
2712,geco,2-1332,"Come,  my  friend,  he  said,  changing  the  subject,  apart  from  Mr.  Inglethorp,  how  did  the  evidence  at  the  inquest  strike  you? "
2713,geco,2-1333,"Oh,  pretty  much  what  I  expected. "
2714,geco,2-1334,Did  nothing  strike  you  as  peculiar  about  it? 
2715,geco,2-1335,"My  thoughts  flew  to  Mary  Cavendish,  and  I  hedged:  In  what  way? "
2716,geco,2-1336,"Well,  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish's  evidence  for  instance? "
2717,geco,2-1337,I  was  relieved. 
2718,geco,2-1338,"Oh,  Lawrence! "
2719,geco,2-1339,"No,  I  don't  think  so. "
2720,geco,2-1340,He's  always  a  nervous  chap. 
2721,geco,2-1341,"His  suggestion  that  his  mother  might  have  been  poisoned  accidentally  by  means  of  the  tonic  she  was  taking,  that  did  not  strike  you  as  strange...hein? "
2722,geco,2-1342,"No,  I  can't  say  it  did. "
2723,geco,2-1343,The  doctors  ridiculed  it  of  course. 
2724,geco,2-1344,But  it  was  quite  a  natural  suggestion  for  a  layman  to  make. 
2725,geco,2-1345,But  Monsieur  Lawrence  is  not  a  layman. 
2726,geco,2-1346,"You  told  me  yourself  that  he  had  started  by  studying  medicine,  and  that  he  had  taken  his  degree. "
2727,geco,2-1347,"Yes,  that's  true. "
2728,geco,2-1348,I  never  thought  of  that. 
2729,geco,2-1349,I  was  rather  startled. 
2730,geco,2-1350,It  is  odd. 
2731,geco,2-1351,Poirot  nodded. 
2732,geco,2-1352,"From  the  first,  his  behaviour  has  been  peculiar. "
2733,geco,2-1353,"Of  all  the  household,  he  alone  would  be  likely  to  recognize  the  symptoms  of  strychnine  poisoning,  and  yet  we  find  him  the  only  member  of  the  family  to  uphold  strenuously  the  theory  of  death  from  natural  causes. "
2734,geco,2-1354,"If  it  had  been  Monsieur  John,  I  could  have  understood  it. "
2735,geco,2-1355,"He  has  no  technical  knowledge,  and  is  by  nature  unimaginative. "
2736,geco,2-1356,But  Monsieur  Lawrence...no! 
2737,geco,2-1357,"And  now,  today,  he  puts  forward  a  suggestion  that  he  himself  must  have  known  was  ridiculous. "
2738,geco,2-1358,"There  is  food  for  thought  in  this,  mon  ami! "
2739,geco,2-1359,"It's  very  confusing,  I  agreed. "
2740,geco,2-1360,"Then  there  is  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  continued  Poirot. "
2741,geco,2-1361,That's  another  who  is  not  telling  all  she  knows! 
2742,geco,2-1362,What  do  you  make  of  her  attitude? 
2743,geco,2-1363,I  don't  know  what  to  make  of  it. 
2744,geco,2-1364,It  seems  inconceivable  that  she  should  be  shielding  Alfred  Inglethorp. 
2745,geco,2-1365,Yet  that  is  what  it  looks  like. 
2746,geco,2-1366,Poirot  nodded  reflectively. 
2747,geco,2-1367,"Yes,  it  is  queer. "
2748,geco,2-1368,"One  thing  is  certain,  she  overheard  a  good  deal  more  of  that  'private  conversation'  than  she  was  willing  to  admit. "
2749,geco,2-1369,And  yet  she  is  the  last  person  one  would  accuse  of  stooping  to  eavesdrop! 
2750,geco,2-1370,Exactly. 
2751,geco,2-1371,One  thing  her  evidence  has  shown  me. 
2752,geco,2-1372,I  made  a  mistake. 
2753,geco,2-1373,Dorcas  was  quite  right. 
2754,geco,2-1374,"The  quarrel  did  take  place  earlier  in  the  afternoon,  about  four  o'clock,  as  she  said. "
2755,geco,2-1375,I  looked  at  him  curiously. 
2756,geco,2-1376,I  had  never  understood  his  insistence  on  that  point. 
2757,geco,2-1377,"Yes,  a  good  deal  that  was  peculiar  came  out  today,  continued  Poirot. "
2758,geco,2-1378,"Dr  Bauerstein,  now,  what  was  he  doing  up  and  dressed  at  that  hour  in  the  morning? "
2759,geco,2-1379,It  is  astonishing  to  me  that  no  one  commented  on  the  fact. 
2760,geco,2-1380,"He  has  insomnia,  I  believe,  I  said  doubtfully. "
2761,geco,2-1381,"Which  is  a  very  good,  or  a  very  bad  explanation,  remarked  Poirot. "
2762,geco,2-1382,"It  covers  everything,  and  explains  nothing. "
2763,geco,2-1383,I  shall  keep  my  eye  on  our  clever  Dr  Bauerstein. 
2764,geco,2-1384,Any  more  faults  to  find  with  the  evidence? 
2765,geco,2-1385,I  inquired  satirically. 
2766,geco,2-1386,"Mon  ami,  replied  Poirot  gravely,  when  you  find  that  people  are  not  telling  you  the  truth...look  out! "
2767,geco,2-1387,"Now,  unless  I  am  much  mistaken,  at  the  inquest  today  only  one...at  most,  two  persons  were  speaking  the  truth  without  reservation  or  subterfuge. "
2768,geco,2-1388,"Oh,  come  now,  Poirot! "
2769,geco,2-1389,"I  won't  cite  Lawrence,  or  Mr.s.  Cavendish. "
2770,geco,2-1390,"But  there's  John...and  Miss  Howard,  surely  they  were  speaking  the  truth? "
2771,geco,2-1391,"Both  of  them,  my  friend? "
2772,geco,2-1392,"One,  I  grant  you,  but  both......! "
2773,geco,2-1393,His  words  gave  me  an  unpleasant  shock. 
2774,geco,2-1394,"Miss  Howard's  evidence,  unimportant  as  it  was,  had  been  given  in  such  a  downright  straightforward  manner  that  it  had  never  occurred  to  me  to  doubt  her  sincerity. "
2775,geco,2-1395,"Still,  I  had  a  great  respect  for  Poirot's  sagacity...except  on  the  occasions  when  he  was  what  I  described  to  myself  as  foolishly  pig-headed. "
2776,geco,2-1396,Do  you  really  think  so?  I  asked. 
2777,geco,2-1397,Miss  Howard  had  always  seemed  to  me  so  essentially  honest...almost  uncomfortably  so. 
2778,geco,2-1398,"Poirot  gave  me  a  curious  look,  which  I  could  not  quite  fathom. "
2779,geco,2-1399,"He  seemed  to  speak,  and  then  checked  himself. "
2780,geco,2-1400,"Miss  Murdoch  too,  I  continued,  there's  nothing  untruthful  about  her. "
2781,geco,2-1401,No. 
2782,geco,2-1402,"But  it  was  strange  that  she  never  heard  a  sound,  sleeping  next  door;  whereas  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  in  the  other  wing  of  the  building,  distinctly  heard  the  table  fall. "
2783,geco,2-1403,"Well,  she's  young. "
2784,geco,2-1404,And  she  sleeps  soundly. 
2785,geco,2-1405,"Ah,  yes,  indeed! "
2786,geco,2-1406,"She  must  be  a  famous  sleeper,  that  one! "
2787,geco,2-1407,"I  did  not  quite  like  the  tone  of  his  voice,  but  at  that  moment  a  smart  knock  reached  our  ears,  and  looking  out  of  the  window  we  perceived  the  two  detectives  waiting  for  us  below. "
2788,geco,2-1408,"Poirot  seized  his  hat,  gave  a  ferocious  twist  to  his  moustache,  and,  carefully  brushing  an  imaginary  speck  of  dust  from  his  sleeve,  motioned  me  to  precede  him  down  the  stairs;  there  we  joined  the  detectives  and  set  out  for  Styles. "
2789,geco,2-1409,"I  think  the  appearance  of  the  two  Scotland  Yard  men  was  rather  a  shock...especially  to  John,  though  of  course  after  the  verdict,  he  had  realized  that  it  was  only  a  matter  of  time. "
2790,geco,2-1410,"Still,  the  presence  of  the  detectives  brought  the  truth  home  to  him  more  than  anything  else  could  have  done. "
2791,geco,2-1411,"Poirot  had  conferred  with  Japp  in  a  low  tone  on  the  way  up,  and  it  was  the  latter  functionary  who  requested  that  the  household,  with  the  exception  of  the  servants,  should  be  assembled  together  in  the  drawing-room. "
2792,geco,2-1412,I  realized  the  significance  of  this. 
2793,geco,2-1413,It  was  up  to  Poirot  to  make  his  boast  good. 
2794,geco,2-1414,"Personally,  I  was  not  sanguine. "
2795,geco,2-1415,"Poirot  might  have  excellent  reasons  for  his  belief  in  Inglethorp's  innocence,  but  a  man  of  the  type  of  Summerhaye  would  require  tangible  proofs,  and  these  I  doubted  if  Poirot  could  supply. "
2796,geco,2-1416,"Before  very  long  we  had  all  trooped  into  the  drawing-room,  the  door  of  which  Japp  closed. "
2797,geco,2-1417,Poirot  politely  set  chairs  for  every  one. 
2798,geco,2-1418,The  Scotland  Yard  men  were  the  cynosure  of  all  eyes. 
2799,geco,2-1419,"I  think  that  for  the  first  time  we  realized  that  the  thing  was  not  a  bad  dream,  but  a  tangible  reality. "
2800,geco,2-1420,We  had  read  of  such  things...now  we  ourselves  were  actors  in  the  drama. 
2801,geco,2-1421,"Tomorrow  the  daily  papers,  all  over  England,  would  blazon  out  the  news  in  staring  headlines:  MYSTERIOUS  TRAGEDY  IN  ESSEX  WEALTHY  LADY  POISONED "
2802,geco,2-1422,"There would  be  pictures  of  Styles,  snap-shots  of  The  family  leaving  the  Inquest ...the  village  photographer  had  not  been  idle! "
2803,geco,2-1423,"All  the  things  that  one  had  read  a  hundred  times,  things  that  happen  to  other  people,  not  to  oneself. "
2804,geco,2-1424,"And  now,  in  this  house,  a  murder  had  been  committed. "
2805,geco,2-1425,In  front  of  us  were  the  detectives  in  charge  of  the  case. 
2806,geco,2-1426,The  well-known  glib  phraseology  passed  rapidly  through  my  mind  in  the  interval  before  Poirot  opened  the  proceedings. 
2807,geco,2-1427,I  think  every  one  was  a  little  surprised  that  it  should  be  he  and  not  one  of  the  official  detectives  who  took  the  initiative. 
2808,geco,2-1428,"Mesdames  and  messieurs,  said  Poirot,  bowing  as  though  he  were  a  celebrity  about  to  deliver  a  lecture,  I  have  asked  you  to  come  here  all  together,  for  a  certain  object. "
2809,geco,2-1429,"That  object,  it  concerns  Mr.  Alfred  Inglethorp. "
2810,geco,2-1430,"Inglethorp  was  sitting  a  little  by  himself...I  think,  unconsciously,  every  one  had  drawn  his  chair  slightly  away  from  him...and  he  gave  a  faint  start  as  Poirot  pronounced  his  name. "
2811,geco,2-1431,"Mr.  Inglethorp,  said  Poirot,  addressing  him  directly,  a  very  dark  shadow  is  resting  on  this  house...the  shadow  of  murder. "
2812,geco,2-1432,Inglethorp  shook  his  head  sadly. 
2813,geco,2-1433,"My  poor  wife,  he  murmured. "
2814,geco,2-1434,Poor  Emily! 
2815,geco,2-1435,It  is  terrible. 
2816,geco,2-1436,"I  do  not  think,  monsieur,  said  Poirot  pointedly,  that  you  quite  realize  how  terrible  it  may  be...for  you. "
2817,geco,2-1437,"And  as  Inglethorp  did  not  appear  to  understand,  he  added:  Mr.  Inglethorp,  you  are  standing  in  very  grave  danger. "
2818,geco,2-1438,The  two  detectives  fidgeted. 
2819,geco,2-1439,"I  saw  the  official  caution  Anything  you  say  will  be  used  in  evidence  against  you,  actually  hovering  on  Summerhaye's  lips. "
2820,geco,2-1440,Poirot  went  on. 
2821,geco,2-1441,"Do  you  understand  now,  monsieur? "
2822,geco,2-1442,No;  What  do  you  mean? 
2823,geco,2-1443,"I  mean,  said  Poirot  deliberately,  that  you  are  suspected  of  poisoning  your  wife. "
2824,geco,2-1444,A  little  gasp  ran  round  the  circle  at  this  plain  speaking. 
2825,geco,2-1445,"Good  heavens!  cried  Inglethorp,  starting  up. "
2826,geco,2-1446,What  a  monstrous  idea! 
2827,geco,2-1447,I...poison  my  dearest  Emily! 
2828,geco,2-1448,I  do  not  think ...Poirot  watched  him  narrowly... that  you  quite  realize  the  unfavourable  nature  of  your  evidence  at  the  inquest. 
2829,geco,2-1449,"Mr.  Inglethorp,  knowing  what  I  have  now  told  you,  do  you  still  refuse  to  say  where  you  were  at  six  o'clock  on  Monday  afternoon? "
2830,geco,2-1450,"With  a  groan,  Alfred  Inglethorp  sank  down  again  and  buried  his  face  in  his  hands. "
2831,geco,2-1451,Poirot  approached  and  stood  over  him. 
2832,geco,2-1452,Speak!  he  cried  menacingly. 
2833,geco,2-1453,"With  an  effort,  Inglethorp  raised  his  face  from  his  hands. "
2834,geco,2-1454,"Then,  slowly  and  deliberately,  he  shook  his  head. "
2835,geco,2-1455,You  will  not  speak? 
2836,geco,2-1456,No. 
2837,geco,2-1457,I  do  not  believe  that  anyone  could  be  so  monstrous  as  to  accuse  me  of  what  you  say. 
2838,geco,2-1458,"Poirot  nodded  thoughtfully,  like  a  man  whose  mind  is  made  up. "
2839,geco,2-1459,Soit!  he  said. 
2840,geco,2-1460,Then  I  must  speak  for  you. 
2841,geco,2-1461,Alfred  Inglethorp  sprang  up  again. 
2842,geco,2-1462,You? 
2843,geco,2-1463,How  can  you  speak? 
2844,geco,2-1464,You  do  not  know......  he  broke  off  abruptly. 
2845,geco,2-1465,Poirot  turned  to  face  us. 
2846,geco,2-1466,Mesdames  and  messieurs! 
2847,geco,2-1467,I  speak! 
2848,geco,2-1468,Listen! 
2849,geco,2-1469,"I,  Hercule  Poirot,  affirm  that  the  man  who  entered  the  chemist's  shop,  and  purchased  strychnine  at  six  o'clock  on  Monday  last  was  not  Mr.  Inglethorp,  for  at  six  o'clock  on  that  day  Mr.  Inglethorp  was  escorting  Mr.s.  Raikes  back  to  her  home  from  a  neighbouring  farm. "
2850,geco,2-1470,"I  can  produce  no  less  than  five  witnesses  to  swear  to  having  seen  them  together,  either  at  six  or  just  after  and,  as  you  may  know,  the  Abbey  Farm,  Mr.s.  Raikes's  home,  is  at  least  two  and  a  half  miles  distant  from  the  village. "
2851,geco,2-1471,There  is  absolutely  no  question  as  to  the  alibi! 
2852,geco,3-1,There  was  a  moment's  stupefied  silence. 
2853,geco,3-2,"Japp,  who  was  the  least  surprised  of  any  of  us,  was  the  first  to  speak. "
2854,geco,3-3,"My  word,  he  cried,  you're  the  goods! "
2855,geco,3-4,"And  no  mistake,  Mr.  Poirot! "
2856,geco,3-5,"These  witnesses  of  yours  are  all  right,  I  suppose? "
2857,geco,3-6,Voila! 
2858,geco,3-7,I  have  prepared  a  list  of  them...names  and  addresses. 
2859,geco,3-8,"You  must  see  them,  of  course. "
2860,geco,3-9,But  you  will  find  it  all  right. 
2861,geco,3-10,I'm  sure  of  that. 
2862,geco,3-11,Japp  lowered  his  voice. 
2863,geco,3-12,I'm  much  obliged  to  you. 
2864,geco,3-13,A  pretty  mare's  nest  arresting  him  would  have  been. 
2865,geco,3-14,He  turned  to  Inglethorp. 
2866,geco,3-15,"But,  if  you'll  excuse  me,  sir,  why  couldn't  you  say  all  this  at  the  inquest? "
2867,geco,3-16,"I  will  tell  you  why,  interrupted  Poirot. "
2868,geco,3-17,There  was  a  certain  rumour...... 
2869,geco,3-18,"A most  malicious  and  utterly  untrue  one,  interrupted  Alfred  Inglethorp  in  an  agitated  voice. "
2870,geco,3-19,And  Mr.  Inglethorp  was  anxious  to  have  no  scandal  revived  just  at  present. 
2871,geco,3-20,Am  I  right? 
2872,geco,3-21,Quite  right. 
2873,geco,3-22,Inglethorp  nodded. 
2874,geco,3-23,"With  my  poor  Emily  not  yet  buried,  can  you  wonder  I  was  anxious  that  no  more  lying  rumours  should  be  started. "
2875,geco,3-24,"Between  you  and  me,  sir,  remarked  Japp,  I'd  sooner  have  any  amount  of  rumours  than  be  arrested  for  murder. "
2876,geco,3-25,And  I  venture  to  think  your  poor  lady  would  have  felt  the  same. 
2877,geco,3-26,"And,  if  it  hadn't  been  for  Mr.  Poirot  here,  arrested  you  would  have  been,  as  sure  as  eggs  is  eggs! "
2878,geco,3-27,"I  was  foolish,  no  doubt,  murmured  Inglethorp. "
2879,geco,3-28,"But  you  do  not  know,  inspector,  how  I  have  been  persecuted  and  maligned. "
2880,geco,3-29,And  he  shot  a  baleful  glance  at  Evelyn  Howard. 
2881,geco,3-30,"Now,  sir,  said  Japp,  turning  briskly  to  John,  I  should  like  to  see  the  lady's  bedroom,  please,  and  after  that  I'll  have  a  little  chat  with  the  servants. "
2882,geco,3-31,Don't  you  bother  about  anything. 
2883,geco,3-32,"Mr.  Poirot,  here,  will  show  me  the  way. "
2884,geco,3-33,"As  they  all  went  out  of  the  room,  Poirot  turned  and  made  me  a  sign  to  follow  him  upstairs. "
2885,geco,3-34,"There  he  caught  me  by  the  arm,  and  drew  me  aside. "
2886,geco,3-35,"Quick,  go  to  the  other  wing. "
2887,geco,3-36,Stand  there...just  this  side  of  the  baize  door. 
2888,geco,3-37,Do  not  move  till  I  come. 
2889,geco,3-38,"Then,  turning  rapidly,  he  rejoined  the  two  detectives. "
2890,geco,3-39,"I  followed  his  instructions,  taking  up  my  position  by  the  baize  door,  and  wondering  what  on  earth  lay  behind  the  request. "
2891,geco,3-40,Why  was  I  to  stand  in  this  particular  spot  on  guard? 
2892,geco,3-41,I  looked  thoughtfully  down  the  corridor  in  front  of  me. 
2893,geco,3-42,An  idea  struck  me. 
2894,geco,3-43,"With  the  exception  of  Cynthia  Murdoch's,  every  one's  room  was  in  this  left  wing. "
2895,geco,3-44,Had  that  anything  to  do  with  it? 
2896,geco,3-45,Was  I  to  report  who  came  or  went? 
2897,geco,3-46,I  stood  faithfully  at  my  post. 
2898,geco,3-47,The  minutes  passed. 
2899,geco,3-48,Nobody  came. 
2900,geco,3-49,Nothing  happened. 
2901,geco,3-50,It  must  have  been  quite  twenty  minutes  before  Poirot  rejoined  me. 
2902,geco,3-51,You  have  not  stirred? 
2903,geco,3-52,"No,  I've  stuck  here  like  a  rock. "
2904,geco,3-53,Nothing's  happened. 
2905,geco,3-54,Ah! 
2906,geco,3-55,"Was  he  pleased,  or  disappointed? "
2907,geco,3-56,You've  seen  nothing  at  all? 
2908,geco,3-57,No. 
2909,geco,3-58,But  you  have  probably  heard  something? 
2910,geco,3-59,"A  big  bump...eh,  mon  ami? "
2911,geco,3-60,No. 
2912,geco,3-61,Is  it  possible? 
2913,geco,3-62,"Ah,  but  I  am  vexed  with  myself! "
2914,geco,3-63,I  am  not  usually  clumsy. 
2915,geco,3-64,"I  made  but  a  slight  gesture ...I  know  Poirot's  gestures... with  the  left  hand,  and  over  went  the  table  by  the  bed! "
2916,geco,3-65,He  looked  so  childishly  vexed  and  crest-fallen  that  I  hastened  to  console  him. 
2917,geco,3-66,"Never  mind,  old  chap. "
2918,geco,3-67,What  does  it  matter? 
2919,geco,3-68,Your  triumph  downstairs  excited  you. 
2920,geco,3-69,"I  can  tell  you,  that  was  a  surprise  to  us  all. "
2921,geco,3-70,"There  must  be  more  in  this  affair  of  Inglethorp's  with  Mr.s.  Raikes  than  we  thought,  to  make  him  hold  his  tongue  so  persistently. "
2922,geco,3-71,What  are  you  going  to  do  now? 
2923,geco,3-72,Where  are  the  Scotland  Yard  fellows? 
2924,geco,3-73,Gone  down  to  interview  the  servants. 
2925,geco,3-74,I  showed  them  all  our  exhibits. 
2926,geco,3-75,I  am  disappointed  in  Japp. 
2927,geco,3-76,He  has  no  method! 
2928,geco,3-77,Hullo! 
2929,geco,3-78,"Hullo!  said,  looking  out  of  the  window. "
2930,geco,3-79,Here's  Dr  Bauerstein. 
2931,geco,3-80,"I  believe  you're  right  about  that  man,  Poirot. "
2932,geco,3-81,I  don't  like  him. 
2933,geco,3-82,"He  is  clever,  observed  Poirot  meditatively. "
2934,geco,3-83,"Oh,  clever  as  the  devil! "
2935,geco,3-84,I  must  say  I  was  overjoyed  to  see  him  in  the  plight  he  was  in  on  Tuesday. 
2936,geco,3-85,You  never  saw  such  a  spectacle! 
2937,geco,3-86,And  I  described  the  doctor's  adventure. 
2938,geco,3-87,He  looked  a  regular  scarecrow! 
2939,geco,3-88,Plastered  with  mud  from  head  to  foot. 
2940,geco,3-89,"You  saw  him,  then? "
2941,geco,3-90,Yes. 
2942,geco,3-91,"Of  course,  he  didn't  want  to  come  in...it  was  just  after  dinner...but  Mr.  Inglethorp  insisted. "
2943,geco,3-92,What? 
2944,geco,3-93,Poirot  caught  me  violently  by  the  shoulders. 
2945,geco,3-94,Was  Dr  Bauerstein  here  on  Tuesday  evening? 
2946,geco,3-95,Here? 
2947,geco,3-96,And  you  never  told  me? 
2948,geco,3-97,Why  did  you  not  tell  me? 
2949,geco,3-98,Why? 
2950,geco,3-99,Why? 
2951,geco,3-100,He  appeared  to  be  in  an  absolute  frenzy. 
2952,geco,3-101,"My  dear  Poirot,  I  expostulated,  I  never  thought  it  would  interest  you. "
2953,geco,3-102,I  didn't  know  it  was  of  any  importance. 
2954,geco,3-103,Importance? 
2955,geco,3-104,It  is  of  the  first  importance! 
2956,geco,3-105,So  DrBauerstein  was  here  on  Tuesday  night...the  night  of  the  murder. 
2957,geco,3-106,"Hastings,  do  you  not  see? "
2958,geco,3-107,That  alters  everything...everything! 
2959,geco,3-108,I  had  never  seen  him  so  upset. 
2960,geco,3-109,"Loosening  his  hold  of  me,  he  mechanically  straightened  a  pair  of  candlesticks,  still  murmuring  to  himself:  Yes,  that  alters  everything...everything. "
2961,geco,3-110,Suddenly  he  seemed  to  come  to  a  decision. 
2962,geco,3-111,Allons!  he  said. 
2963,geco,3-112,We  must  act  at  once. 
2964,geco,3-113,Where  is  Mr.  Cavendish? 
2965,geco,3-114,John  was  in  the  smoking-room. 
2966,geco,3-115,Poirot  went  straight  to  him. 
2967,geco,3-116,"Mr.  Cavendish,  I  have  some  important  business  in  Tadminster. "
2968,geco,3-117,A  new  clue. 
2969,geco,3-118,May  I  take  your  motor? 
2970,geco,3-119,"Why,  of  course. "
2971,geco,3-120,Do  you  mean  at  once? 
2972,geco,3-121,If  you  please. 
2973,geco,3-122,"John  rang  the  bell,  and  ordered  round  the  car. "
2974,geco,3-123,"In  another  ten  minutes,  we  were  racing  down  the  park  and  along  the  high  road  to  Tadminster. "
2975,geco,3-124,"Now,  Poirot,  I  remarked  resignedly,  perhaps  you  will  tell  me  what  all  this  is  about? "
2976,geco,3-125,"Well,  mon  ami,  a  good  deal  you  can  guess  for  yourself. "
2977,geco,3-126,"Of  course  you  realize  that,  now  Mr.  Inglethorp  is  out  of  it,  the  whole  position  is  greatly  changed. "
2978,geco,3-127,We  are  face  to  face  with  an  entirely  new  problem. 
2979,geco,3-128,We  know  now  that  there  is  one  person  who  did  not  buy  the  poison. 
2980,geco,3-129,We  have  cleared  away  the  manufactured  clues. 
2981,geco,3-130,Now  for  the  real  ones. 
2982,geco,3-131,"I  have  ascertained  that  anyone  in  the  household,  with  the  exception  of  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  who  was  playing  tennis  with  you,  could  have  personated  Mr.  Inglethorp  on  Monday  evening. "
2983,geco,3-132,"In  the  same  way,  we  have  his  statement  that  he  put  the  coffee  down  in  the  hall. "
2984,geco,3-133,No  one  took  much  notice  of  that  at  the  inquest...but  now  it  has  a  very  different  significance. 
2985,geco,3-134,"We  must  find  out  who  did  take  that  coffee  to  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  eventually,  or  who  passed  through  the  hall  whilst  it  was  standing  there. "
2986,geco,3-135,"From  your  account,  there  are  only  two  people  whom  we  can  positively  say  did  not  go  near  the  coffee...Mr.s.  Cavendish,  and  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. "
2987,geco,3-136,"Yes,  that  is  so. "
2988,geco,3-137,I  felt  an  inexpressible  lightening  of  the  heart. 
2989,geco,3-138,Mary  Cavendish  could  certainly  not  rest  under  suspicion. 
2990,geco,3-139,"In  clearing  Alfred  Inglethorp,  continued  Poirot,  I  have  been  obliged  to  show  my  hand  sooner  than  I  intended. "
2991,geco,3-140,"As  long  as  I  might  be  thought  to  be  pursuing  him,  the  criminal  would  be  off  his  guard. "
2992,geco,3-141,"Now,  he  will  be  doubly  careful. "
2993,geco,3-142,Yes...doubly  careful. 
2994,geco,3-143,He  turned  to  me  abruptly. 
2995,geco,3-144,"Tell  me,  Hastings,  you  yourself...have  you  no  suspicions  of  anybody? "
2996,geco,3-145,I  hesitated. 
2997,geco,3-146,"To  tell  the  truth,  an  idea,  wild  and  extravagant  in  itself,  had  once  or  twice  that  morning  flashed  through  my  brain. "
2998,geco,3-147,"I  had  rejected  it  as  absurd,  nevertheless  it  persisted. "
2999,geco,3-148,"You  couldn't  call  it  a  suspicion,  I  murmured. "
3000,geco,3-149,It's  so  utterly  foolish. 
3001,geco,3-150,"Come  now,  urged  Poirot  encouragingly. "
3002,geco,3-151,Do  not  fear. 
3003,geco,3-152,Speak  your  mind. 
3004,geco,3-153,You  should  always  pay  attention  to  your  instincts. 
3005,geco,3-154,"Well  then,  I  blurted  out,  it's  absurd...but  I  suspect  Miss  Howard  of  not  telling  all  she  knows! "
3006,geco,3-155,Miss  Howard? 
3007,geco,3-156,Yes...you'll  laugh  at  me......  Not  at  all. 
3008,geco,3-157,Why  should  I? 
3009,geco,3-158,"I  can't  help  feeling,  I  continued  blunderingly;  that  we've  rather  left  her  out  of  the  possible  suspects,  simply  on  the  strength  of  her  having  been  away  from  the  place. "
3010,geco,3-159,"But,  after  all,  she  was  only  fifteen  miles  away. "
3011,geco,3-160,A  car  would  do  it  in  half  an  hour. 
3012,geco,3-161,Can  we  say  positively  that  she  was  away  from  Styles  on  the  night  of  the  murder? 
3013,geco,3-162,"Yes,  my  friend,  said  Poirot  unexpectedly,  we  can. "
3014,geco,3-163,One  of  my  first  actions  was  to  ring  up  the  hospital  where  she  was  working. 
3015,geco,3-164,Well? 
3016,geco,3-165,"Well,  I  learnt  that  Miss  Howard  had  been  on  afternoon  duty  on  Tuesday,  and  that...a  convoy  coming  in  unexpectedly...she  had  kindly  offered  to  remain  on  night  duty,  which  offer  was  gratefully  accepted. "
3017,geco,3-166,That  disposes  of  that. 
3018,geco,3-167,"Oh!  I  said,  rather  nonplussed. "
3019,geco,3-168,"Really,  I  continued,  it's  her  extraordinary  vehemence  against  Inglethorp  that  started  me  off  suspecting  her. "
3020,geco,3-169,I  can't  help  feeling  she'd  do  anything  against  him. 
3021,geco,3-170,And  I  had  an  idea  she  might  know  something  about  the  destroying  of  the  will. 
3022,geco,3-171,"She  might  have  burnt  the  new  one,  mistaking  it  for  the  earlier  one  in  his  favour. "
3023,geco,3-172,She  is  so  terribly  bitter  against  him. 
3024,geco,3-173,You  consider  her  vehemence  unnatural? 
3025,geco,3-174,Y...es. 
3026,geco,3-175,She  is  so  very  violent. 
3027,geco,3-176,I  wondered  really  whether  she  is  quite  sane  on  that  point. 
3028,geco,3-177,Poirot  shook  his  head  energetically. 
3029,geco,3-178,"No,  no,  you  are  on  a  wrong  tack  there. "
3030,geco,3-179,There  is  nothing  weak-minded  or  degenerate  about  Miss  Howard. 
3031,geco,3-180,She  is  an  excellent  specimen  of  well-balanced  English  beef  and  brawn. 
3032,geco,3-181,She  is  sanity  itself. 
3033,geco,3-182,Yet  her  hatred  of  Inglethorp  seems  almost  a  mania. 
3034,geco,3-183,"My  idea  was...a  very  ridiculous  one,  no  doubt...that  she  had  intended  to  poison  him...and  that,  in  some  way,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  got  hold  of  it  by  mistake. "
3035,geco,3-184,But  I  don't  at  all  see  how  it  could  have  been  done. 
3036,geco,3-185,The  whole  thing  is  absurd  and  ridiculous  to  the  last  degree. 
3037,geco,3-186,Still  you  are  right  in  one  thing. 
3038,geco,3-187,"It  is  always  wise  to  suspect  everybody  until  you  can  prove  logically,  and  to  your  own  satisfaction,  that  they  are  innocent. "
3039,geco,3-188,"Now,  what  reasons  are  there  against  Miss  Howard's  having  deliberately  poisoned  Mr.s.  Inglethorp? "
3040,geco,3-189,"Why,  she  was  devoted  to  her!  I  exclaimed. "
3041,geco,3-190,Tcha!  Tcha!  cried  Poirot  irritably. 
3042,geco,3-191,You  argue  like  a  child. 
3043,geco,3-192,"If  Miss  Howard  were  capable  of  poisoning  the  old  lady,  she  would  be  quite  equally  capable  of  simulating  devotion. "
3044,geco,3-193,"No,  we  must  look  elsewhere. "
3045,geco,3-194,You  are  perfectly  correct  in  your  assumption  that  her  vehemence  against  Alfred  Inglethorp  is  too  violent  to  be  natural;  but  you  are  quite  wrong  in  the  deduction  you  draw  from  it. 
3046,geco,3-195,"I  have  drawn  my  own  deductions,  which  I  believe  to  be  correct,  but  I  will  not  speak  of  them  at  present. "
3047,geco,3-196,"He  paused  a  minute,  then  went  on. "
3048,geco,3-197,"Now,  to  my  way  of  thinking,  there  is  one  insuperable  objection  to  Miss  Howard's  being  the  murderess. "
3049,geco,3-198,And  that  is? 
3050,geco,3-199,That  in  no  possible  way  could  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  death  benefit  Miss  Howard. 
3051,geco,3-200,Now  there  is  no  murder  without  a  motive. 
3052,geco,3-201,I  reflected. 
3053,geco,3-202,Could  not  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  have  made  a  will  in  her  favour? 
3054,geco,3-203,Poirot  shook  his  head. 
3055,geco,3-204,But  you  yourself  suggested  that  possibility  to  Mr.  Wells? 
3056,geco,3-205,Poirot  smiled. 
3057,geco,3-206,That  was  for  a  reason. 
3058,geco,3-207,I  did  not  want  to  mention  the  name  of  the  person  who  was  actually  in  my  mind. 
3059,geco,3-208,"Miss  Howard  occupied  very  much  the  same  position,  so  I  used  her  name  instead. "
3060,geco,3-209,"Still,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  might  have  done  so. "
3061,geco,3-210,"Why,  that  will,  made  on  the  afternoon  of  her  death  may...... "
3062,geco,3-211,But Poirot's  shake  of  the  head  was  so  energetic  that  I  stopped. 
3063,geco,3-212,"No,  my  friend. "
3064,geco,3-213,I  have  certain  little  ideas  of  my  own  about  that  will. 
3065,geco,3-214,But  I  can  tell  you  this  much...it  was  not  in  Miss  Howard's  favour. 
3066,geco,3-215,"I  accepted  his  assurance,  though  I  did  not  really  see  how  he  could  be  so  positive  about  the  matter. "
3067,geco,3-216,"Well,  I  said,  with  a  sigh,  we  will  acquit  Miss  Howard,  then. "
3068,geco,3-217,It  is  partly  your  fault  that  I  ever  came  to  suspect  her. 
3069,geco,3-218,It  was  what  you  said  about  her  evidence  at  the  inquest  that  set  me  off. 
3070,geco,3-219,Poirot  looked  puzzled. 
3071,geco,3-220,What  did  I  say  about  her  evidence  at  the  inquest? 
3072,geco,3-221,Don't  you  remember? 
3073,geco,3-222,When  I  cited  her  and  John  Cavendish  as  being  above  suspicion? 
3074,geco,3-223,Oh...ah...yes. 
3075,geco,3-224,"He  seemed  a  little  confused,  but  recovered  himself. "
3076,geco,3-225,"By  the  way,  Hastings,  there  is  something  I  want  you  to  do  for  me. "
3077,geco,3-226,Certainly. 
3078,geco,3-227,What  is  it? 
3079,geco,3-228,"Next  time  you  happen  to  be  alone  with  Lawrence  Cavendish,  I  want  you  to  say  this  to  him. "
3080,geco,3-229,"'I  have  a  message  for  you,  from  Poirot. "
3081,geco,3-230,"He  says:  Find  the  extra  coffee-cup,  and  you  can  rest  in  peace! "
3082,geco,3-231,'  Nothing  more. 
3083,geco,3-232,Nothing  less. 
3084,geco,3-233,"'Find  the  extra  coffee-cup,  and  you  can  rest  in  peace.' "
3085,geco,3-234,"Is  that  right?  I  asked,  much  mystified. "
3086,geco,3-235,Excellent. 
3087,geco,3-236,But  what  does  it  mean? 
3088,geco,3-237,"Ah,  that  I  will  leave  you  to  find  out. "
3089,geco,3-238,You  have  access  to  the  facts. 
3090,geco,3-239,"Just  say  that  to  him,  and  see  what  he  says. "
3091,geco,3-240,Very  well...but  it's  all  extremely  mysterious. 
3092,geco,3-241,"We  were  running  into  Tadminster  now,  and  Poirot  directed  the  car  to  the  Analytical  Chemist. "
3093,geco,3-242,"Poirot  hopped  down  briskly,  and  went  inside. "
3094,geco,3-243,In  a  few  minutes  he  was  back  again. 
3095,geco,3-244,"There,  he  said. "
3096,geco,3-245,That  is  all  my  business. 
3097,geco,3-246,"What  were  you  doing  there?  I  asked,  in  lively  curiosity. "
3098,geco,3-247,I  left  something  to  be  analysed. 
3099,geco,3-248,"Yes,  but  what? "
3100,geco,3-249,The  sample  of  cocoa  I  took  from  the  saucepan  in  the  bedroom. 
3101,geco,3-250,"But  that  has  already  been  tested!  I  cried,  stupefied. "
3102,geco,3-251,"Dr  Bauerstein  had  it  tested,  and  you  yourself  laughed  at  the  possibility  of  there  being  strychnine  in  it. "
3103,geco,3-252,"I  know  Dr  Bauerstein  had  it  tested,  replied  Poirot  quietly. "
3104,geco,3-253,"Well,  then? "
3105,geco,3-254,"Well,  I  have  a  fancy  for  having  it  analysed  again,  that  is  all. "
3106,geco,3-255,And  not  another  word  on  the  subject  could  I  drag  out  of  him. 
3107,geco,3-256,"This  proceeding  of  Poirot's,  in  respect  of  the  cocoa,  puzzled  me  intensely. "
3108,geco,3-257,I  could  see  neither  rhyme  nor  reason  in  it. 
3109,geco,3-258,"However,  my  confidence  in  him,  which  at  one  time  had  rather  waned,  was  fully  restored  since  his  belief  in  Alfred  Inglethorp's  innocence  had  been  so  triumphantly  vindicated. "
3110,geco,3-259,"The  funeral  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  took  place  the  following  day,  and  on  Monday,  as  I  came  down  to  a  late  breakfast,  John  drew  me  aside,  and  informed  me  that  Mr.  Inglethorp  was  leaving  that  morning,  to  take  up  his  quarters  at  the  Stylites  Arms  until  he  should  have  completed  his  plans. "
3111,geco,3-260,"And  really  it's  a  great  relief  to  think  he's  going,  Hastings,  continued  my  honest  friend. "
3112,geco,3-261,"It  was  bad  enough  before,  when  we  thought  he'd  done  it,  but  I'm  hanged  if  it  isn't  worse  now,  when  we  all  feel  guilty  for  having  been  so  down  on  the  fellow. "
3113,geco,3-262,"The  fact  is,  we've  treated  him  abominably. "
3114,geco,3-263,"Of  course,  things  did  look  black  against  him. "
3115,geco,3-264,I  don't  see  how  anyone  could  blame  us  for  jumping  to  the  conclusions  we  did. 
3116,geco,3-265,"Still,  there  it  is,  we  were  in  the  wrong,  and  now  there's  a  beastly  feeling  that  one  ought  to  make  amends;  which  is  difficult,  when  one  doesn't  like  the  fellow  a  bit  better  than  one  did  before. "
3117,geco,3-266,The  whole  thing's  damned  awkward! 
3118,geco,3-267,And  I'm  thankful  he's  had  the  tact  to  take  himself  off. 
3119,geco,3-268,It's  a  good  thing  Styles  wasn't  the  mater's  to  leave  to  him. 
3120,geco,3-269,Couldn't  bear  to  think  of  the  fellow  lording  it  here. 
3121,geco,3-270,He's  welcome  to  her  money. 
3122,geco,3-271,You'll  be  able  to  keep  up  the  place  all  right?  I  asked. 
3123,geco,3-272,"Oh,  yes. "
3124,geco,3-273,"There  are  the  death  duties,  of  course,  but  half  my  father's  money  goes  with  the  place,  and  Lawrence  will  stay  with  us  for  the  present,  so  there  is  his  share  as  well. "
3125,geco,3-274,"We  shall  be  pinched  at  first,  of  course,  because,  as  I  once  told  you,  I  am  in  a  bit  of  a  hole  financially  myself. "
3126,geco,3-275,"Still,  the  Johnnies  will  wait  now. "
3127,geco,3-276,"In  the  general  relief  at  Inglethorp's  approaching  departure,  we  had  the  most  genial  breakfast  we  had  experienced  since  the  tragedy. "
3128,geco,3-277,"Cynthia,  whose  young  spirits  were  naturally  buoyant,  was  looking  quite  her  pretty  self  again,  and  we  all,  with  the  exception  of  Lawrence,  who  seemed  unalterably  gloomy  and  nervous,  were  quietly  cheerful,  at  the  opening  of  a  new  and  hopeful  future. "
3129,geco,3-278,"The  papers,  of  course,  had  been  full  of  the  tragedy. "
3130,geco,3-279,"Glaring  headlines,  sandwiched  biographies  of  every  member  of  the  household,  subtle  innuendoes,  the  usual  familiar  tag  about  the  police  having  a  clue. "
3131,geco,3-280,Nothing  was  spared  us. 
3132,geco,3-281,It  was  a  slack  time. 
3133,geco,3-282,"The  war  was  momentarily  inactive,  and  the  newspapers  seized  with  avidity  on  this  crime  in  fashionable  life:  The  Mysterious  Affair  at  Styles  was  the  topic  of  the  moment. "
3134,geco,3-283,Naturally  it  was  very  annoying  for  the  Cavendishes. 
3135,geco,3-284,"The  house  was  constantly  besieged  by  reporters,  who  were  consistently  denied  admission,  but  who  continued  to  haunt  the  village  and  the  grounds,  where  they  lay  in  wait  with  cameras,  for  any  unwary  members  of  the  household. "
3136,geco,3-285,We  all  lived  in  a  blast  of  publicity. 
3137,geco,3-286,"The  Scotland  Yard  men  came  and  went,  examining,  questioning,  lynx-eyed  and  reserved  of  tongue. "
3138,geco,3-287,"Towards  what  end  they  were  working,  we  did  not  know. "
3139,geco,3-288,"Had  they  any  clue,  or  would  the  whole  thing  remain  in  the  category  of  undiscovered  crimes? "
3140,geco,3-289,"After  breakfast,  Dorcas  came  up  to  me  rather  mysteriously,  and  asked  if  she  might  have  a  few  words  with  me. "
3141,geco,3-290,Certainly. 
3142,geco,3-291,"What  is  it,  Dorcas? "
3143,geco,3-292,"Well,  it's  just  this,  sir. "
3144,geco,3-293,You'll  be  seeing  the  Belgian  gentleman  today  perhaps? 
3145,geco,3-294,I  nodded. 
3146,geco,3-295,"Well,  sir,  you  know  how  he  asked  me  so  particular  if  the  mistress,  or  anyone  else,  had  a  green  dress? "
3147,geco,3-296,"Yes,  yes. "
3148,geco,3-297,You  have  found  one? 
3149,geco,3-298,My  interest  was  aroused. 
3150,geco,3-299,"No,  not  that,  sir. "
3151,geco,3-300,"But  since  then  I've  remembered  what  the  young  gentlemen,  John  and  Lawrence  were  still  the  'young  gentlemen'  to  Dorcas,  call  the  'dressing-up  box.' "
3152,geco,3-301,"It's  up  in  the  front  attic,  sir. "
3153,geco,3-302,"A  great  chest,  full  of  old  clothes  and  fancy  dresses,  and  what  not. "
3154,geco,3-303,And  it  came  to  me  sudden  like  that  there  might  be  a  green  dress  amongst  them. 
3155,geco,3-304,"So,  if  you'd  tell  the  Belgian  gentleman...... "
3156,geco,3-305,"I will  tell  him,  Dorcas,  I  promised. "
3157,geco,3-306,"Thank  you  very  much,  sir. "
3158,geco,3-307,"A  very  nice  gentleman  he  is,  sir. "
3159,geco,3-308,"And  quite  a  different  class  from  them  two  detectives  from  London,  what  goes  prying  about,  and  asking  questions. "
3160,geco,3-309,"I  don't  hold  with  foreigners  as  a  rule,  but  from  what  the  newspapers  say  I  make  out  as  how  these  brave  Belges  isn't  the  ordinary  run  of  foreigners,  and  certainly  he's  a  most  polite  spoken  gentleman. "
3161,geco,3-310,Dear  old  Dorcas! 
3162,geco,3-311,"As  she  stood  there,  with  her  honest  face  upturned  to  mine,  I  thought  what  a  fine  specimen  she  was  of  the  old-fashioned  servant  that  is  so  fast  dying  out. "
3163,geco,3-312,"I  thought  I  might  as  well  go  down  to  the  village  at  once,  and  look  up  Poirot;  but  I  met  him  half-way,  coming  up  to  the  house,  and  at  once  gave  him  Dorcas's  message. "
3164,geco,3-313,"Ah,  the  brave  Dorcas! "
3165,geco,3-314,"We  will  look  at  the  chest,  although...but  no  matter...we  will  examine  it  all  the  same. "
3166,geco,3-315,We  entered  the  house  by  one  of  the  windows. 
3167,geco,3-316,"There  was  no  one  in  the  hall,  and  we  went  straight  up  to  the  attic. "
3168,geco,3-317,"Sure  enough,  there  was  the  chest,  a  fine  old  piece,  all  studded  with  brass  nails,  and  full  to  overflowing  with  every  imaginable  type  of  garment. "
3169,geco,3-318,Poirot  bundled  everything  out  on  the  floor  with  scant  ceremony. 
3170,geco,3-319,There  were  one  or  two  green  fabrics  of  varying  shades;  but  Poirot  shook  his  head  over  them  all. 
3171,geco,3-320,"He  seemed  somewhat  apathetic  in  the  search,  as  though  he  expected  no  great  results  from  it. "
3172,geco,3-321,Suddenly  he  gave  an  exclamation. 
3173,geco,3-322,What  is  it? 
3174,geco,3-323,Look! 
3175,geco,3-324,"The  chest  was  nearly  empty,  and  there,  reposing  right  at  the  bottom,  was  a  magnificent  black  beard. "
3176,geco,3-325,Oho!  said  Poirot. 
3177,geco,3-326,Oho! 
3178,geco,3-327,"He  turned  it  over  in  his  hands,  examining  it  closely. "
3179,geco,3-328,"New,  he  remarked. "
3180,geco,3-329,"Yes,  quite  new. "
3181,geco,3-330,"After  a  moment's  hesitation,  he  replaced  it  in  the  chest,  heaped  all  the  other  things  on  top  of  it  as  before,  and  made  his  way  briskly  downstairs. "
3182,geco,3-331,"He  went  straight  to  the  pantry,  where  we  found  Dorcas  busily  polishing  her  silver. "
3183,geco,3-332,"Poirot  wished  her  good  morning  with  Gallic  politeness,  and  went  on:  We  have  been  looking  through  that  chest,  Dorcas. "
3184,geco,3-333,I  am  much  obliged  to  you  for  mentioning  it. 
3185,geco,3-334,"There  is,  indeed,  a  fine  collection  there. "
3186,geco,3-335,"Are  they  often  used,  may  I  ask? "
3187,geco,3-336,"Well,  sir,  not  very  often  nowadays,  though  from  time  to  time  we  do  have  what  the  young  gentlemen  call  'a  dress-up  night.' "
3188,geco,3-337,"And  very  funny  it  is  sometimes,  sir. "
3189,geco,3-338,"Mr.  Lawrence,  he's  wonderful. "
3190,geco,3-339,Most  comic! 
3191,geco,3-340,"I  shall  never  forget  the  night  he  came  down  as  the  Char  of  Persia,  I  think  he  called  it...a  sort  of  Eastern  King  it  was. "
3192,geco,3-341,"He  had  the  big  paper  knife  in  his  hand,  and  'Mind,  Dorcas,'  he  says,  'you'll  have  to  be  very  respectful. "
3193,geco,3-342,"This  is  my  specially  sharpened  scimitar,  and  it's  off  with  your  head  if  I'm  at  all  displeased  with  you!' "
3194,geco,3-343,"Miss  Cynthia,  she  was  what  they  call  an  Apache,  or  some  such  name...a  Frenchified  sort  of  cut-throat,  I  take  it  to  be. "
3195,geco,3-344,A  real  sight  she  looked. 
3196,geco,3-345,You'd  never  have  believed  a  pretty  young  lady  like  that  could  have  made  herself  into  such  a  ruffian. 
3197,geco,3-346,Nobody  would  have  known  her. 
3198,geco,3-347,"These  evenings  must  have  been  great  fun,  said  Poirot  genially. "
3199,geco,3-348,"I  suppose  Mr.  Lawrence  wore  that  fine  black  beard  in  the  chest  upstairs,  when  he  was  Shah  of  Persia? "
3200,geco,3-349,"He  did  have  a  beard,  sir,  replied  Dorcas,  smiling. "
3201,geco,3-350,"And  well  I  know  it,  for  he  borrowed  two  skeins  of  my  black  wool  to  make  it  with! "
3202,geco,3-351,And  I'm  sure  it  looked  wonderfully  natural  at  a  distance. 
3203,geco,3-352,I  didn't  know  as  there  was  a  beard  up  there  at  all. 
3204,geco,3-353,"It  must  have  been  got  quite  lately,  I  think. "
3205,geco,3-354,"There  was  a  red  wig,  I  know,  but  nothing  else  in  the  way  of  hair. "
3206,geco,3-355,Burnt  corks  they  use  mostly...though  'tis  messy  getting  it  off  again. 
3207,geco,3-356,"Miss  Cynthia  was  a  nigger  once,  and,  oh,  the  trouble  she  had. "
3208,geco,3-357,"So  Dorcas  knows  nothing  about  that  black  beard,  said  Poirot  thoughtfully,  as  we  walked  out  into  the  hall  again. "
3209,geco,3-358,Do  you  think  it  is  the  one? 
3210,geco,3-359,I  whispered  eagerly. 
3211,geco,3-360,Poirot  nodded. 
3212,geco,3-361,I  do. 
3213,geco,3-362,You  notice  it  had  been  trimmed? 
3214,geco,3-363,No. 
3215,geco,3-364,Yes. 
3216,geco,3-365,"It  was  cut  exactly  the  shape  of  Mr.  Inglethorp's,  and  I  found  one  or  two  snipped  hairs. "
3217,geco,3-366,"Hastings,  this  affair  is  very  deep. "
3218,geco,3-367,"Who  put  it  in  the  chest,  I  wonder? "
3219,geco,3-368,"Some  one  with  a  good  deal  of  intelligence,  remarked  Poirot  dryly. "
3220,geco,3-369,You  realize  that  he  chose  the  one  place  in  the  house  to  hide  it  where  its  presence  would  not  be  remarked? 
3221,geco,3-370,"Yes,  he  is  intelligent. "
3222,geco,3-371,But  we  must  be  more  intelligent. 
3223,geco,3-372,We  must  be  so  intelligent  that  he  does  not  suspect  us  of  being  intelligent  at  all. 
3224,geco,3-373,I  acquiesced. 
3225,geco,3-374,"There,  mon  ami,  you  will  be  of  great  assistance  to  me. "
3226,geco,3-375,I  was  pleased  with  the  compliment. 
3227,geco,3-376,There  had  been  times  when  I  hardly  thought  that  Poirot  appreciated  me  at  my  true  worth. 
3228,geco,3-377,"Yes,  he  continued,  staring  at  me  thoughtfully,  you  will  be  invaluable. "
3229,geco,3-378,"This  was  naturally  gratifying,  but  Poirot's  next  words  were  not  so  welcome. "
3230,geco,3-379,"I  must  have  an  ally  in  the  house,  he  observed  reflectively. "
3231,geco,3-380,"You  have  me,  I  protested. "
3232,geco,3-381,"True,  but  you  are  not  sufficient. "
3233,geco,3-382,"I  was  hurt,  and  showed  it. "
3234,geco,3-383,Poirot  hurried  to  explain  himself. 
3235,geco,3-384,You  do  not  quite  take  my  meaning. 
3236,geco,3-385,You  are  known  to  be  working  with  me. 
3237,geco,3-386,I  want  somebody  who  is  not  associated  with  us  in  any  way. 
3238,geco,3-387,"Oh,  I  see. "
3239,geco,3-388,How  about  John? 
3240,geco,3-389,"No,  I  think  not. "
3241,geco,3-390,"The  dear  fellow  isn't  perhaps  very  bright,  I  said  thoughtfully. "
3242,geco,3-391,"Here  comes  Miss  Howard,  said  Poirot  suddenly. "
3243,geco,3-392,She  is  the  very  person. 
3244,geco,3-393,"But  I  am  in  her  black  books,  since  I  cleared  Mr.  Inglethorp. "
3245,geco,3-394,"Still,  we  can  but  try. "
3246,geco,3-395,"With  a  nod  that  was  barely  civil,  Miss  Howard  assented  to  Poirot's  request  for  a  few  minutes'  conversation. "
3247,geco,3-396,"We  went  into  the  little  morning-room,  and  Poirot  closed  the  door. "
3248,geco,3-397,"Well,  Monsieur  Poirot,  said  Miss  Howard  impatiently,  what  is  it? "
3249,geco,3-398,Out  with  it. 
3250,geco,3-399,I'm  busy. 
3251,geco,3-400,"Do  you  remember,  mademoiselle,  that  I  once  asked  you  to  help  me? "
3252,geco,3-401,"Yes,  I  do. "
3253,geco,3-402,The  lady  nodded. 
3254,geco,3-403,And  I  told  you  I'd  help  you  with  pleasure...to  hang  Alfred  Inglethorp. 
3255,geco,3-404,Ah! 
3256,geco,3-405,Poirot  studied  her  seriously. 
3257,geco,3-406,"Miss  Howard,  I  will  ask  you  one  question. "
3258,geco,3-407,I  beg  of  you  to  reply  to  it  truthfully. 
3259,geco,3-408,"Never  tell  lies,  replied  Miss  Howard. "
3260,geco,3-409,It  is  this. 
3261,geco,3-410,Do  you  still  believe  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  poisoned  by  her  husband? 
3262,geco,3-411,What  do  you  mean?  she  asked  sharply. 
3263,geco,3-412,You  needn't  think  your  pretty  explanations  influence  me  in  the  slightest. 
3264,geco,3-413,I'll  admit  that  it  wasn't  he  who  bought  strychnine  at  the  chemist's  shop. 
3265,geco,3-414,What  of  that? 
3266,geco,3-415,"I  dare  say  he  soaked  fly  paper,  as  I  told  you  at  the  beginning. "
3267,geco,3-416,"That  is  arsenic...not  strychnine,  said  Poirot  mildly. "
3268,geco,3-417,What  does  that  matter? 
3269,geco,3-418,Arsenic  would  put  poor  Emily  out  of  the  way  just  as  well  as  strychnine. 
3270,geco,3-419,"If  I'm  convinced  he  did  it,  it  doesn't  matter  a  jot  to  me  how  he  did  it. "
3271,geco,3-420,Exactly. 
3272,geco,3-421,"If  you  are  convinced  he  did  it,  said  Poirot  quietly. "
3273,geco,3-422,I  will  put  my  question  in  another  form. 
3274,geco,3-423,Did  you  ever  in  your  heart  of  hearts  believe  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  poisoned  by  her  husband? 
3275,geco,3-424,Good  heavens!  cried  Miss  Howard. 
3276,geco,3-425,Haven't  I  always  told  you  the  man  is  a  villain? 
3277,geco,3-426,Haven't  I  always  told  you  he  would  murder  her  in  her  bed? 
3278,geco,3-427,Haven't  I  always  hated  him  like  poison? 
3279,geco,3-428,"Exactly,  said  Poirot. "
3280,geco,3-429,That  bears  out  my  little  idea  entirely. 
3281,geco,3-430,What  little  idea? 
3282,geco,3-431,"Miss  Howard,  do  you  remember  a  conversation  that  took  place  on  the  day  of  my  friend's  arrival  here? "
3283,geco,3-432,"He  repeated  it  to  me,  and  there  is  a  sentence  of  yours  that  has  impressed  me  very  much. "
3284,geco,3-433,"Do  you  remember  affirming  that  if  a  crime  had  been  committed,  and  anyone  you  loved  had  been  murdered,  you  felt  certain  that  you  would  know  by  instinct  who  the  criminal  was,  even  if  you  were  quite  unable  to  prove  it? "
3285,geco,3-434,"Yes,  I  remember  saying  that. "
3286,geco,3-435,I  believe  it  too. 
3287,geco,3-436,I  suppose  you  think  it  nonsense? 
3288,geco,3-437,Not  at  all. 
3289,geco,3-438,And  yet  you  will  pay  no  attention  to  my  instinct  against  Alfred  Inglethorp. 
3290,geco,3-439,"No,  said  Poirot  curtly. "
3291,geco,3-440,Because  your  instinct  is  not  against  Mr.  Inglethorp. 
3292,geco,3-441,What? 
3293,geco,3-442,No. 
3294,geco,3-443,You  wish  to  believe  he  committed  the  crime. 
3295,geco,3-444,You  believe  him  capable  of  committing  it. 
3296,geco,3-445,But  your  instinct  tells  you  he  did  not  commit  it. 
3297,geco,3-446,It  tells  you  more...shall  I  go  on? 
3298,geco,3-447,"She  was  staring  at  him,  fascinated,  and  made  a  slight  affirmative  movement  of  the  hand. "
3299,geco,3-448,Shall  I  tell  you  why  you  have  been  so  vehement  against  Mr.  Inglethorp? 
3300,geco,3-449,It  is  because  you  have  been  trying  to  believe  what  you  wish  to  believe. 
3301,geco,3-450,"It  is  because  you  are  trying  to  drown  and  stifle  your  instinct,  which  tells  you  another  name...... "
3302,geco,3-451,"No, no,  no!  cried  Miss  Howard  wildly,  flinging  up  her  hands. "
3303,geco,3-452,Don't  say  it! 
3304,geco,3-453,"Oh,  don't  say  it! "
3305,geco,3-454,It  isn't  true! 
3306,geco,3-455,It  can't  be  true. 
3307,geco,3-456,I  don't  know  what  put  such  a  wild...such  a  dreadful...idea  into  my  head! 
3308,geco,3-457,"I  am  right,  am  I  not?  asked  Poirot. "
3309,geco,3-458,"Yes,  yes;  you  must  be  a  wizard  to  have  guessed. "
3310,geco,3-459,"But  it  can't  be  so...it's  too  monstrous,  too  impossible. "
3311,geco,3-460,It  must  be  Alfred  Inglethorp. 
3312,geco,3-461,Poirot  shook  his  head  gravely. 
3313,geco,3-462,"Don't  ask  me  about  it,  continued  Miss  Howard,  because  I  shan't  tell  you. "
3314,geco,3-463,"I  won't  admit  it,  even  to  myself. "
3315,geco,3-464,I  must  be  mad  to  think  of  such  a  thing. 
3316,geco,3-465,"Poirot  nodded,  as  if  satisfied. "
3317,geco,3-466,I  will  ask  you  nothing. 
3318,geco,3-467,It  is  enough  for  me  that  it  is  as  I  thought. 
3319,geco,3-468,"And  I...I,  too,  have  an  instinct. "
3320,geco,3-469,We  are  working  together  towards  a  common  end. 
3321,geco,3-470,"Don't  ask  me  to  help  you,  because  I  won't. "
3322,geco,3-471,I  wouldn't  lift  a  finger  to...to...... 
3323,geco,3-472,She faltered. 
3324,geco,3-473,You  will  help  me  in  spite  of  yourself. 
3325,geco,3-474,I  ask  you  nothing...but  you  will  be  my  ally. 
3326,geco,3-475,You  will  not  be  able  to  help  yourself. 
3327,geco,3-476,You  will  do  the  only  thing  that  I  want  of  you. 
3328,geco,3-477,And  that  is? 
3329,geco,3-478,You  will  watch! 
3330,geco,3-479,Evelyn  Howard  bowed  her  head. 
3331,geco,3-480,"Yes,  I  can't  help  doing  that. "
3332,geco,3-481,I  am  always  watching...always  hoping  I  shall  be  proved  wrong. 
3333,geco,3-482,"If  we  are  wrong,  well  and  good,  said  Poirot. "
3334,geco,3-483,No  one  will  be  more  pleased  than  I  shall. 
3335,geco,3-484,"But,  if  we  are  right? "
3336,geco,3-485,"If  we  are  right,  Miss  Howard,  on  whose  side  are  you  then? "
3337,geco,3-486,"I  don't  know,  I  don't  know...... "
3338,geco,3-487,Come now. 
3339,geco,3-488,It  could  be  hushed  up. 
3340,geco,3-489,There  must  be  no  hushing  up. 
3341,geco,3-490,But  Emily  herself......  She  broke  off. 
3342,geco,3-491,"Miss  Howard,  said  Poirot  gravely,  this  is  unworthy  of  you. "
3343,geco,3-492,Suddenly  she  took  her  face  from  her  hands. 
3344,geco,3-493,"Yes,  she  said  quietly,  that  was  not  Evelyn  Howard  who  spoke! "
3345,geco,3-494,She  flung  her  head  up  proudly. 
3346,geco,3-495,This  is  Evelyn  Howard! 
3347,geco,3-496,And  she  is  on  the  side  of  Justice! 
3348,geco,3-497,Let  the  cost  be  what  it  may. 
3349,geco,3-498,"And  with  these  words,  she  walked  firmly  out  of  the  room. "
3350,geco,3-499,"There,  said  Poirot,  looking  after  her,  goes  a  very  valuable  ally. "
3351,geco,3-500,"That  woman,  Hastings,  has  got  brains  as  well  as  a  heart. "
3352,geco,3-501,I  did  not  reply. 
3353,geco,3-502,"Instinct  is  a  marvellous  thing,  mused  Poirot. "
3354,geco,3-503,It  can  neither  be  explained  nor  ignored. 
3355,geco,3-504,"You  and  Miss  Howard  seem  to  know  what  you  are  talking  about,  I  observed  coldly. "
3356,geco,3-505,Perhaps  you  don't  realize  that  I  am  still  in  the  dark. 
3357,geco,3-506,Really? 
3358,geco,3-507,"Is  that  so,  mon  ami? "
3359,geco,3-508,Yes. 
3360,geco,3-509,"Enlighten  me,  will  you? "
3361,geco,3-510,Poirot  studied  me  attentively  for  a  moment  or  two. 
3362,geco,3-511,"Then,  to  my  intense  surprise,  he  shook  his  head  decidedly. "
3363,geco,3-512,"No,  my  friend. "
3364,geco,3-513,"Oh,  look  here,  why  not? "
3365,geco,3-514,Two  is  enough  for  a  secret. 
3366,geco,3-515,"Well,  I  think  it  is  very  unfair  to  keep  back  facts  from  me. "
3367,geco,3-516,I  am  not  keeping  back  facts. 
3368,geco,3-517,Every  fact  that  I  know  is  in  your  possession. 
3369,geco,3-518,You  can  draw  your  own  deductions  from  them. 
3370,geco,3-519,This  time  it  is  a  question  of  ideas. 
3371,geco,3-520,"Still,  it  would  be  interesting  to  know. "
3372,geco,3-521,"Poirot  looked  at  me  very  earnestly,  and  again  shook  his  head. "
3373,geco,3-522,"You  see,  he  said  sadly,  you  have  no  instincts. "
3374,geco,3-523,"It  was  intelligence  you  were  requiring  just  now,  I  pointed  out. "
3375,geco,3-524,"The  two  often  go  together,  said  Poirot  enigmatically. "
3376,geco,3-525,The  remark  seemed  so  utterly  irrelevant  that  I  did  not  even  take  the  trouble  to  answer  it. 
3377,geco,3-526,"But  I  decided  that  if  I  made  any  interesting  and  important  discoveries...as  no  doubt  I  should...I  would  keep  them  to  myself,  and  surprise  Poirot  with  the  ultimate  result. "
3378,geco,3-527,There  are  times  when  it  is  one's  duty  to  assert  oneself. 
3379,geco,3-528,I  had  had  no  opportunity  as  yet  of  passing  on  Poirot's  message  to  Lawrence. 
3380,geco,3-529,"But  now,  as  I  strolled  out  on  the  lawn,  still  nursing  a  grudge  against  my  friend's  high-handedness,  I  saw  Lawrence  on  the  croquet  lawn,  aimlessly  knocking  a  couple  of  very  ancient  balls  about,  with  a  still  more  ancient  mallet. "
3381,geco,3-530,It  struck  me  that  it  would  be  a  good  opportunity  to  deliver  my  message. 
3382,geco,3-531,"Otherwise,  Poirot  himself  might  relieve  me  of  it. "
3383,geco,3-532,"It  was  true  that  I  did  not  quite  gather  its  purport,  but  I  flattered  myself  that  by  Lawrence's  reply,  and  perhaps  a  little  skillful  cross-examination  on  my  part,  I  should  soon  perceive  its  significance. "
3384,geco,3-533,Accordingly  I  accosted  him. 
3385,geco,3-534,"I've  been  looking  for  you,  I  remarked  untruthfully. "
3386,geco,3-535,Have  you? 
3387,geco,3-536,Yes. 
3388,geco,3-537,"The  truth  is,  I've  got  a  message  for  you...from  Poirot. "
3389,geco,3-538,Yes? 
3390,geco,3-539,"He  told  me  to  wait  until  I  was  alone  with  you,  I  said,  dropping  my  voice  significantly,  and  watching  him  intently  out  of  the  corner  of  my  eye. "
3391,geco,3-540,"I  have  always  been  rather  good  at  what  is  called,  I  believe,  creating  an  atmosphere. "
3392,geco,3-541,Well? 
3393,geco,3-542,There  was  no  change  of  expression  in  the  dark  melancholic  face. 
3394,geco,3-543,Had  he  any  idea  of  what  I  was  about  to  say? 
3395,geco,3-544,This  is  the  message. 
3396,geco,3-545,I  dropped  my  voice  still  lower. 
3397,geco,3-546,"'Find  the  extra  coffee-cup,  and  you  can  rest  in  peace.' "
3398,geco,3-547,What  on  earth  does  he  mean? 
3399,geco,3-548,Lawrence  stared  at  me  in  quite  unaffected  astonishment. 
3400,geco,3-549,Don't  you  know? 
3401,geco,3-550,Not  in  the  least. 
3402,geco,3-551,Do  you? 
3403,geco,3-552,I  was  compelled  to  shake  my  head. 
3404,geco,3-553,What  extra  coffee-cup? 
3405,geco,3-554,I  don't  know. 
3406,geco,3-555,"He'd  better  ask  Dorcas,  or  one  of  the  maids,  if  he  wants  to  know  about  coffee-cups. "
3407,geco,3-556,"It's  their  business,  not  mine. "
3408,geco,3-557,"I  don't  know  anything  about  the  coffee-cups,  except  that  we've  got  some  that  are  never  used,  which  are  a  perfect  dream! "
3409,geco,3-558,Old  Worcester. 
3410,geco,3-559,"You're  not  a  connoisseur,  are  you,  Hastings? "
3411,geco,3-560,I  shook  my  head. 
3412,geco,3-561,You  miss  a  lot. 
3413,geco,3-562,"A  really  perfect  bit  of  old  china...it's  pure  delight  to  handle  it,  or  even  to  look  at  it. "
3414,geco,3-563,"Well,  what  am  I  to  tell  Poirot? "
3415,geco,3-564,Tell  him  I  don't  know  what  he's  talking  about. 
3416,geco,3-565,It's  double  Dutch  to  me. 
3417,geco,3-566,All  right. 
3418,geco,3-567,I  was  moving  off  towards  the  house  again  when  he  suddenly  called  me  back. 
3419,geco,3-568,"I  say,  what  was  the  end  of  that  message? "
3420,geco,3-569,"Say  it  over  again,  will  you? "
3421,geco,3-570,"'Find  the  extra  coffee-cup,  and  you  can  rest  in  peace.' "
3422,geco,3-571,Are  you  sure  you  don't  know  what  it  means?  I  asked  him  earnestly. 
3423,geco,3-572,He  shook  his  head. 
3424,geco,3-573,"No,  he  said  musingly,  I  don't. "
3425,geco,3-574,I...I  wish  I  did. 
3426,geco,3-575,"The  boom  of  the  gong  sounded  from  the  house,  and  we  went  in  together. "
3427,geco,3-576,"Poirot  had  been  asked  by  John  to  remain  to  lunch,  and  was  already  seated  at  the  table. "
3428,geco,3-577,"By  tacit  consent,  all  mention  of  the  tragedy  was  barred. "
3429,geco,3-578,"We  conversed  on  the  war,  and  other  outside  topics. "
3430,geco,3-579,"But  after  the  cheese  and  biscuits  had  been  handed  round,  and  Dorcas  had  left  the  room,  Poirot  suddenly  leant  forward  to  Mr.s.  Cavendish. "
3431,geco,3-580,"Pardon  me,  madame,  for  recalling  unpleasant  memories,  but  I  have  a  little  idea ...Poirot's  little  ideas  were  becoming  a  perfect  byword... and  would  like  to  ask  one  or  two  questions. "
3432,geco,3-581,Of  me? 
3433,geco,3-582,Certainly. 
3434,geco,3-583,"You  are  too  amiable,  madame. "
3435,geco,3-584,"What  I  want  to  ask  is  this:  the  door  leading  into  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room  from  that  of  Mademoiselle  Cynthia,  it  was  bolted,  you  say? "
3436,geco,3-585,"Certainly  it  was  bolted,  replied  Mary  Cavendish,  rather  surprised. I "
3437,geco,3-586,said  so  at  the  inquest. 
3438,geco,3-587,Bolted? 
3439,geco,3-588,Yes. 
3440,geco,3-589,She  looked  perplexed. 
3441,geco,3-590,"I  mean,  explained  Poirot,  you  are  sure  it  was  bolted,  and  not  merely  locked? "
3442,geco,3-591,"Oh,  I  see  what  you  mean. "
3443,geco,3-592,"No,  I  don't  know. "
3444,geco,3-593,"I  said  bolted,  meaning  that  it  was  fastened,  and  I  could  not  open  it,  but  I  believe  all  the  doors  were  found  bolted  on  the  inside. "
3445,geco,3-594,"Still,  as  far  as  you  are  concerned,  the  door  might  equally  well  have  been  locked? "
3446,geco,3-595,"Oh,  yes. "
3447,geco,3-596,"You  yourself  did  not  happen  to  notice,  madame,  when  you  entered  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room,  whether  that  door  was  bolted  or  not? "
3448,geco,3-597,I...I  believe  it  was. 
3449,geco,3-598,But  you  did  not  see  it? 
3450,geco,3-599,No. 
3451,geco,3-600,I...never  looked. 
3452,geco,3-601,"But  I  did,  interrupted  Lawrence  suddenly. "
3453,geco,3-602,I  happened  to  notice  that  it  was  bolted. 
3454,geco,3-603,"Ah,  that  settles  it. "
3455,geco,3-604,And  Poirot  looked  crestfallen. 
3456,geco,3-605,"I  could  not  help  rejoicing  that,  for  once,  one  of  his  little  ideas  had  come  to  naught. "
3457,geco,3-606,After  lunch  Poirot  begged  me  to  accompany  him  home. 
3458,geco,3-607,I  consented  rather  stiffly. 
3459,geco,3-608,"You  are  annoyed,  is  it  not  so?  he  asked  anxiously,  as  we  walked  through  the  park. "
3460,geco,3-609,"Not  at  all,  I  said  coldly. "
3461,geco,3-610,That  is  well. 
3462,geco,3-611,That  lifts  a  great  load  from  my  mind. 
3463,geco,3-612,This  was  not  quite  what  I  had  intended. 
3464,geco,3-613,I  had  hoped  that  he  would  have  observed  the  stiffness  of  my  manner. 
3465,geco,3-614,"Still,  the  fervour  of  his  words  went  towards  the  appeasing  of  my  just  displeasure. "
3466,geco,3-615,I  thawed. 
3467,geco,3-616,"I  gave  Lawrence  your  message,  I  said. "
3468,geco,3-617,And  what  did  he  say? 
3469,geco,3-618,He  was  entirely  puzzled? 
3470,geco,3-619,Yes. 
3471,geco,3-620,I  am  quite  sure  he  had  no  idea  of  what  you  meant. 
3472,geco,3-621,"I  had  expected  Poirot  to  be  disappointed;  but,  to  my  surprise,  he  replied  that  that  was  as  he  had  thought,  and  that  he  was  very  glad. "
3473,geco,3-622,My  pride  forbade  me  to  ask  any  questions. 
3474,geco,3-623,Poirot  switched  off  on  another  tack. 
3475,geco,3-624,Mademoiselle  Cynthia  was  not  at  lunch  today? 
3476,geco,3-625,How  was  that? 
3477,geco,3-626,She  is  at  the  hospital  again. 
3478,geco,3-627,She  resumed  work  today. 
3479,geco,3-628,"Ah,  she  is  an  industrious  little  demoiselle. "
3480,geco,3-629,And  pretty  too. 
3481,geco,3-630,She  is  like  pictures  I  have  seen  in  Italy. 
3482,geco,3-631,I  would  rather  like  to  see  that  dispensary  of  hers. 
3483,geco,3-632,Do  you  think  she  would  show  it  to  me? 
3484,geco,3-633,I  am  sure  she  would  be  delighted. 
3485,geco,3-634,It's  an  interesting  little  place. 
3486,geco,3-635,Does  she  go  there  every  day? 
3487,geco,3-636,"She  has  all  Wednesdays  off,  and  comes  back  to  lunch  on  Saturdays. "
3488,geco,3-637,Those  are  her  only  times  off. 
3489,geco,3-638,I  will  remember. 
3490,geco,3-639,"Women  are  doing  great  work  nowadays,  and  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  is  clever...oh,  yes,  she  has  brains,  that  little  one. "
3491,geco,3-640,Yes. 
3492,geco,3-641,I  believe  she  has  passed  quite  a  stiff  exam. 
3493,geco,3-642,Without  doubt. 
3494,geco,3-643,"After  all,  it  is  very  responsible  work. "
3495,geco,3-644,I  suppose  they  have  very  strong  poisons  there? 
3496,geco,3-645,"Yes,  she  showed  them  to  us. "
3497,geco,3-646,They  are  kept  locked  up  in  a  little  cupboard. 
3498,geco,3-647,I  believe  they  have  to  be  very  careful. 
3499,geco,3-648,They  always  take  out  the  key  before  leaving  the  room. 
3500,geco,3-649,Indeed. 
3501,geco,3-650,"It  is  near  the  window,  this  cupboard? "
3502,geco,3-651,"No,  right  the  other  side  of  the  room. "
3503,geco,3-652,Why? 
3504,geco,3-653,Poirot  shrugged  his  shoulders. 
3505,geco,3-654,I  wondered. 
3506,geco,3-655,That  is  all. 
3507,geco,3-656,Will  you  come  in? 
3508,geco,3-657,We  had  reached  the  cottage. 
3509,geco,3-658,No. 
3510,geco,3-659,I  think  I'll  be  getting  back. 
3511,geco,3-660,I  shall  go  round  the  long  way  through  the  woods. 
3512,geco,3-661,The  woods  round  Styles  were  very  beautiful. 
3513,geco,3-662,"After  the  walk  across  the  open  park,  it  was  pleasant  to  saunter  lazily  through  the  cool  glades. "
3514,geco,3-663,"There  was  hardly  a  breath  of  wind,  the  very  chirp  of  the  birds  was  faint  and  subdued. "
3515,geco,3-664,"I  strolled  on  a  little  way,  and  finally  flung  myself  down  at  the  foot  of  a  grand  old  beech-tree. "
3516,geco,3-665,My  thoughts  of  mankind  were  kindly  and  charitable. 
3517,geco,3-666,I  even  forgave  Poirot  for  his  absurd  secrecy. 
3518,geco,3-667,"In  fact,  I  was  at  peace  with  the  world. "
3519,geco,3-668,Then  I  yawned. 
3520,geco,3-669,"I  thought  about  the  crime,  and  it  struck  me  as  being  very  unreal  and  far  off. "
3521,geco,3-670,I  yawned  again. 
3522,geco,3-671,"Probably,  I  thought,  it  really  never  happened. "
3523,geco,3-672,"Of  course,  it  was  all  a  bad  dream. "
3524,geco,3-673,The  truth  of  the  matter  was  that  it  was  Lawrence  who  had  murdered  Alfred  Inglethorp  with  a  croquet  mallet. 
3525,geco,3-674,"But  it  was  absurd  of  John  to  make  such  a  fuss  about  it,  and  to  go  shouting  out:  I  tell  you  I  won't  have  it! "
3526,geco,3-675,I  woke  up  with  a  start. 
3527,geco,3-676,At  once  I  realized  that  I  was  in  a  very  awkward  predicament. 
3528,geco,3-677,"For,  about  twelve  feet  away  from  me,  John  and  Mary  Cavendish  were  standing  facing  each  other,  and  they  were  evidently  quarrelling. "
3529,geco,3-678,"And,  quite  as  evidently,  they  were  unaware  of  my  vicinity,  for  before  I  could  move  or  speak  John  repeated  the  words  which  had  aroused  me  from  my  dream. "
3530,geco,3-679,"I  tell  you,  Mary,  I  won't  have  it. "
3531,geco,3-680,"Mary's  voice  came,  cool  and  liquid:  Have  you  any  right  to  criticize  my  actions? "
3532,geco,3-681,It  will  be  the  talk  of  the  village! 
3533,geco,3-682,"My  mother  was  only  buried  on  Saturday,  and  here  you  are  gadding  about  with  the  fellow. "
3534,geco,3-683,"Oh,  she  shrugged  her  shoulders,  if  it  is  only  village  gossip  that  you  mind! "
3535,geco,3-684,But  it  isn't. 
3536,geco,3-685,I've  had  enough  of  the  fellow  hanging  about. 
3537,geco,3-686,"He's  a  Polish  Jew,  anyway. "
3538,geco,3-687,A  tinge  of  Jewish  blood  is  not  a  bad  thing. 
3539,geco,3-688,It  leavens  the ...she  looked  at  him... stolid  stupidity  of  the  ordinary  Englishman. 
3540,geco,3-689,"Fire  in  her  eyes,  ice  in  her  voice. "
3541,geco,3-690,I  did  not  wonder  that  the  blood  rose  to  John's  face  in  a  crimson  tide. 
3542,geco,3-691,Mary! 
3543,geco,3-692,Well? 
3544,geco,3-693,Her  tone  did  not  change. 
3545,geco,3-694,The  pleading  died  out  of  his  voice. 
3546,geco,3-695,Am  I  to  understand  that  you  will  continue  to  see  Bauerstein  against  my  express  wishes? 
3547,geco,3-696,If  I  choose. 
3548,geco,3-697,You  defy  me? 
3549,geco,3-698,"No,  but  I  deny  your  right  to  criticize  my  actions. "
3550,geco,3-699,Have  you  no  friends  of  whom  I  should  disapprove? 
3551,geco,3-700,John  fell  back  a  pace.The 
3552,geco,3-701,colour  ebbed  slowly  from  his  face. 
3553,geco,3-702,"What  do  you  mean?  he  said,  in  an  unsteady  voice. "
3554,geco,3-703,You  see!  said  Mary  quietly. 
3555,geco,3-704,"You  do  see,  don't  you,  that  you  have  no  right  to  dictate  to  me  as  to  the  choice  of  my  friends? "
3556,geco,3-705,"John  glanced  at  her  pleadingly,  a  stricken  look  on  his  face. "
3557,geco,3-706,No  right? 
3558,geco,3-707,"Have  I  no  right,  Mary?  he  said  unsteadily. "
3559,geco,3-708,He  stretched  out  his  hands. 
3560,geco,3-709,Mary...... 
3561,geco,3-710,"For a  moment,  I  thought  she  wavered. "
3562,geco,3-711,"A  softer  expression  came  over  her  face,  then  suddenly  she  turned  almost  fiercely  away. "
3563,geco,3-712,None! 
3564,geco,3-713,Mary ...his  voice  was  very  quiet  now... are  you  in  love  with  this  fellow  Bauerstein? 
3565,geco,3-714,"She  hesitated,  and  suddenly  there  swept  across  her  face  a  strange  expression,  old  as  the  hills,  yet  with  something  eternally  young  about  it. "
3566,geco,3-715,So  might  some  Egyptian  sphinx  have  smiled. 
3567,geco,3-716,"She  freed  herself  quietly  from  his  arm,  and  spoke  over  her  shoulder. "
3568,geco,3-717,"Perhaps,  she  said;  and  then  swiftly  passed  out  of  the  little  glade,  leaving  John  standing  there  as  though  he  had  been  turned  to  stone. "
3569,geco,3-718,"Rather  ostentatiously,  I  stepped  forward,  crackling  some  dead  branches  with  my  feet  as  I  did  so. "
3570,geco,3-719,John  turned. 
3571,geco,3-720,"Luckily,  he  took  it  for  granted  that  I  had  only  just  come  upon  the  scene. "
3572,geco,3-721,"Hullo,  Hastings. "
3573,geco,3-722,Have  you  seen  the  little  fellow  safely  back  to  his  cottage? 
3574,geco,3-723,Quaint  little  chap! 
3575,geco,3-724,"Is  he  any  good,  though,  really? "
3576,geco,3-725,He  was  considered  one  of  the  finest  detectives  of  his  day. 
3577,geco,3-726,"Oh,  well,  I  suppose  there  must  be  something  in  it,  then. "
3578,geco,3-727,"What  a  rotten  world  it  is,  though! "
3579,geco,3-728,You  find  it  so?  I  asked. 
3580,geco,3-729,"Good  Lord,  yes! "
3581,geco,3-730,There's  this  terrible  business  to  start  with. 
3582,geco,3-731,Scotland  Yard  men  in  and  out  of  the  house  like  a  jack-in-the-box! 
3583,geco,3-732,Never  know  where  they  won't  turn  up  next. 
3584,geco,3-733,"Screaming  headlines  in  every  paper  in  the  country...damn  all  journalists,  I  say! "
3585,geco,3-734,Do  you  know  there  was  a  whole  crowd  staring  in  at  the  lodge  gates  this  morning. 
3586,geco,3-735,Sort  of  Madame  Tussaud's  chamber  of  horrors  business  that  can  be  seen  for  nothing. 
3587,geco,3-736,"Pretty  thick,  isn't  it? "
3588,geco,3-737,"Cheer  up,  John!  I  said  soothingly. "
3589,geco,3-738,It  can't  last  for  ever. 
3590,geco,3-739,"Can't  it,  though? "
3591,geco,3-740,It  can  last  long  enough  for  us  never  to  be  able  to  hold  up  our  heads  again. 
3592,geco,3-741,"No,  no,  you're  getting  morbid  on  the  subject. "
3593,geco,3-742,"Enough  to  make  a  man  morbid,  to  be  stalked  by  beastly  journalists  and  stared  at  by  gaping  moon-faced  idiots,  wherever  he  goes! "
3594,geco,3-743,But  there's  worse  than  that. 
3595,geco,3-744,What? 
3596,geco,3-745,"John  lowered  his  voice:  Have  you  ever  thought,  Hastings...it's  a  nightmare  to  me...who  did  it? "
3597,geco,3-746,I  can't  help  feeling  sometimes  it  must  have  been  an  accident. 
3598,geco,3-747,Because...because...who  could  have  done  it? 
3599,geco,3-748,"Now  Inglethorp's  out  of  the  way,  there's  no  one  else;  no  one,  I  mean,  except...one  of  us. "
3600,geco,3-749,"Yes,  indeed,  that  was  nightmare  enough  for  any  man! "
3601,geco,3-750,One  of  us? 
3602,geco,3-751,"Yes,  surely  it  must  be  so,  unless......-  A  new  idea  suggested  itself  to  my  mind. "
3603,geco,3-752,"Rapidly,  I  considered  it. "
3604,geco,3-753,The  light  increased. 
3605,geco,3-754,"Poirot's  mysterious  doings,  his  hints...they  all  fitted  in. "
3606,geco,3-755,"Fool  that  I  was  not  to  have  thought  of  this  possibility  before,  and  what  a  relief  for  us  all. "
3607,geco,3-756,"No,  John,  I  said,  it  isn't  one  of  us. "
3608,geco,3-757,How  could  it  be? 
3609,geco,3-758,"I  know,  but,  still,  who  else  is  there? "
3610,geco,3-759,Can't  you  guess? 
3611,geco,3-760,No. 
3612,geco,3-761,"I  looked  cautiously  round,  and  lowered  my  voice. "
3613,geco,3-762,Dr  Bauerstein! 
3614,geco,3-763,I  whispered. 
3615,geco,3-764,Impossible! 
3616,geco,3-765,Not  at  all. 
3617,geco,3-766,But  what  earthly  interest  could  he  have  in  my  mother's  death? 
3618,geco,3-767,"That  I  don't  see,  I  confessed,  but  I'll  tell  you  this:  Poirot  thinks  so. "
3619,geco,3-768,Poirot? 
3620,geco,3-769,Does  he? 
3621,geco,3-770,How  do  you  know? 
3622,geco,3-771,"I  told  him  of  Poirot's  intense  excitement  on  hearing  that  Dr  Bauerstein  had  been  at  Styles  on  the  fatal  night,  and  added:  He  said  twice:  'That  alters  everything.' "
3623,geco,3-772,And  I've  been  thinking. 
3624,geco,3-773,You  know  Inglethorp  said  he  had  put  down  the  coffee  in  the  hall? 
3625,geco,3-774,"Well,  it  was  just  then  that  Bauerstein  arrived. "
3626,geco,3-775,"Isn't  it  possible  that,  as  Inglethorp  brought  him  through  the  hall,  the  doctor  dropped  something  into  the  coffee  in  passing? "
3627,geco,3-776,"H'm,  said  John. "
3628,geco,3-777,It  would  have  been  very  risky. 
3629,geco,3-778,"Yes,  but  it  was  possible. "
3630,geco,3-779,"And  then,  how  could  he  know  it  was  her  coffee? "
3631,geco,3-780,"No,  old  fellow,  I  don't  think  that  will  wash. "
3632,geco,3-781,But  I  had  remembered  something  else. 
3633,geco,3-782,You're  quite  right. 
3634,geco,3-783,That  wasn't  how  it  was  done. 
3635,geco,3-784,Listen. 
3636,geco,3-785,And  I  then  told  him  of  the  cocoa  sample  which  Poirot  had  taken  to  be  analysed. 
3637,geco,3-786,John  interrupted  just  as  I  had  done. 
3638,geco,3-787,"But,  look  here,  Bauerstein  had  had  it  analysed  already? "
3639,geco,3-788,"Yes,  yes,  that's  the  point. "
3640,geco,3-789,I  didn't  see  it  either  until  now. 
3641,geco,3-790,Don't  you  understand? 
3642,geco,3-791,Bauerstein  had  it  analysed...that's  just  it! 
3643,geco,3-792,"If  Bauerstein's  the  murderer,  nothing  could  be  simpler  than  for  him  to  substitute  some  ordinary  cocoa  for  his  sample,  and  send  that  to  be  tested. "
3644,geco,3-793,And  of  course  they  would  find  no  strychnine! 
3645,geco,3-794,"But  no  one  would  dream  of  suspecting  Bauerstein,  or  think  of  taking  another  sample...except  Poirot,  I  added,  with  belated  recognition. "
3646,geco,3-795,"Yes,  but  what  about  the  bitter  taste  that  cocoa  won't  disguise? "
3647,geco,3-796,"Well,  we've  only  his  word  for  that. "
3648,geco,3-797,And  there  are  other  possibilities. 
3649,geco,3-798,He's  admittedly  one  of  the  world's  greatest  toxicologists...... 
3650,geco,3-799,One of  the  world's  greatest  what? 
3651,geco,3-800,Say  it  again. 
3652,geco,3-801,"He  knows  more  about  poisons  than  almost  anybody,  I  explained. "
3653,geco,3-802,"Well,  my  idea  is,  that  perhaps  he's  found  some  way  of  making  strychnine  tasteless. "
3654,geco,3-803,"Or  it  may  not  have  been  strychnine  at  all,  but  some  obscure  drug  no  one  has  ever  heard  of,  which  produces  much  the  same  symptoms. "
3655,geco,3-804,"H'm,  yes,  that  might  be,  said  John. "
3656,geco,3-805,"But  look  here,  how  could  he  have  got  at  the  cocoa? "
3657,geco,3-806,That  wasn't  downstairs? 
3658,geco,3-807,"No,  it  wasn't,  I  admitted  reluctantly. "
3659,geco,3-808,"And  then,  suddenly,  a  dreadful  possibility  flashed  through  my  mind. "
3660,geco,3-809,I  hoped  and  prayed  it  would  not  occur  to  John  also. 
3661,geco,3-810,I  glanced  sideways  at  him. 
3662,geco,3-811,"He  was  frowning  perplexedly,  and  I  drew  a  deep  breath  of  relief,  for  the  terrible  thought  that  had  flashed  across  my  mind  was  this:  that  Dr  Bauerstein  might  have  had  an  accomplice. "
3663,geco,3-812,Yet  surely  it  could  not  be! 
3664,geco,3-813,Surely  no  woman  as  beautiful  as  Mary  Cavendish  could  be  a  murderess. 
3665,geco,3-814,Yet  beautiful  women  had  been  known  to  poison. 
3666,geco,3-815,"And  suddenly  I  remembered  that  first  conversation  at  tea  on  the  day  of  my  arrival,  and  the  gleam  in  her  eyes  as  she  had  said  that  poison  was  a  woman's  weapon. "
3667,geco,3-816,How  agitated  she  had  been  on  that  fatal  Tuesday  evening! 
3668,geco,3-817,"Had  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  discovered  something  between  her  and  Bauerstein,  and  threatened  to  tell  her  husband? "
3669,geco,3-818,Was  it  to  stop  that  denunciation  that  the  crime  had  been  committed? 
3670,geco,3-819,Then  I  remembered  that  enigmatical  conversation  between  Poirot  and  Evelyn  Howard. 
3671,geco,3-820,Was  this  what  they  had  meant? 
3672,geco,3-821,Was  this  the  monstrous  possibility  that  Evelyn  had  tried  not  to  believe? 
3673,geco,3-822,"Yes,  it  all  fitted  in. "
3674,geco,3-823,No  wonder  Miss  Howard  had  suggested  hushing  it  up. 
3675,geco,3-824,Now  I  understood  that  unfinished  sentence  of  hers:  Emily  herself...... 
3676,geco,3-825,And in  my  heart  I  agreed  with  her. 
3677,geco,3-826,Would  not  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  have  preferred  to  go  unavenged  rather  than  have  such  terrible  dishonour  fall  upon  the  name  of  Cavendish. 
3678,geco,3-827,"There's  another  thing,  said  John  suddenly,  and  the  unexpected  sound  of  his  voice  made  me  start  guiltily. "
3679,geco,3-828,Something  which  makes  me  doubt  if  what  you  say  can  be  true. 
3680,geco,3-829,"What's  that?  I  asked,  thankful  that  he  had  gone  away  from  the  subject  of  how  the  poison  could  have  been  introduced  into  the  cocoa. "
3681,geco,3-830,"Why,  the  fact  that  Bauerstein  demanded  a  post-mortem. "
3682,geco,3-831,He  needn't  have  done  so. 
3683,geco,3-832,Little  Wilkins  would  have  been  quite  content  to  let  it  go  at  heart  disease. 
3684,geco,3-833,"Yes,  I  said  doubtfully. "
3685,geco,3-834,But  we  don't  know. 
3686,geco,3-835,Perhaps  he  thought  it  safer  in  the  long  run. 
3687,geco,3-836,Some  one  might  have  talked  afterwards. 
3688,geco,3-837,Then  the  Home  Office  might  have  ordered  exhumation. 
3689,geco,3-838,"The  whole  thing  would  have  come  out,  then,  and  he  would  have  been  in  an  awkward  position,  for  no  one  would  have  believed  that  a  man  of  his  reputation  could  have  been  deceived  into  calling  it  heart  disease. "
3690,geco,3-839,"Yes,  that's  possible,  admitted  John. "
3691,geco,3-840,"Still,  he  added,  I'm  blest  if  I  can  see  what  his  motive  could  have  been. "
3692,geco,3-841,I  trembled. 
3693,geco,3-842,"Look  here,  I  said,  I  may  be  altogether  wrong. "
3694,geco,3-843,"And,  remember,  all  this  is  in  confidence. "
3695,geco,3-844,"Oh,  of  course...that  goes  without  saying. "
3696,geco,3-845,"We  had  walked,  as  we  talked,  and  now  we  passed  through  the  little  gate  into  the  garden. "
3697,geco,3-846,"Voices  rose  near  at  hand,  for  tea  was  spread  out  under  the  sycamore-tree,  as  it  had  been  on  the  day  of  my  arrival. "
3698,geco,3-847,"Cynthia  was  back  from  the  hospital,  and  I  placed  my  chair  beside  her,  and  told  her  of  Poirot's  wish  to  visit  the  dispensary. "
3699,geco,3-848,Of  course! 
3700,geco,3-849,I'd  love  him  to  see  it. 
3701,geco,3-850,He'd  better  come  to  tea  there  one  day. 
3702,geco,3-851,I  must  fix  it  up  with  him. 
3703,geco,3-852,He's  such  a  dear  little  man! 
3704,geco,3-853,But  he  is  funny. 
3705,geco,3-854,"He  made  me  take  the  brooch  out  of  my  tie  the  other  day,  and  put  it  in  again,  because  he  said  it  wasn't  straight. "
3706,geco,3-855,I  laughed. 
3707,geco,3-856,It's  quite  a  mania  with  him. 
3708,geco,3-857,"Yes,  isn't  it? "
3709,geco,3-858,"We  were  silent  for  a  minute  or  two,  and  then,  glancing  in  the  direction  of  Mary  Cavendish,  and  dropping  her  voice,  Cynthia  said:  Mr.  Hastings. "
3710,geco,3-859,Yes? 
3711,geco,3-860,"After  tea,  I  want  to  talk  to  you. "
3712,geco,3-861,Her  glance  at  Mary  had  set  me  thinking. 
3713,geco,3-862,I  fancied  that  between  these  two  there  existed  very  little  sympathy. 
3714,geco,3-863,"For  the  first  time,  it  occurred  to  me  to  wonder  about  the  girl's  future. "
3715,geco,3-864,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  made  no  provisions  of  any  kind  for  her,  but  I  imagined  that  John  and  Mary  would  probably  insist  on  her  making  her  home  with  them...at  any  rate  until  the  end  of  the  war. "
3716,geco,3-865,"John,  I  knew,  was  very  fond  of  her,  and  would  be  sorry  to  let  her  go. "
3717,geco,3-866,"John,  who  had  gone  into  the  house,  now  reappeared. "
3718,geco,3-867,His  good-natured  face  wore  an  unaccustomed  frown  of  anger. 
3719,geco,3-868,Confound  those  detectives! 
3720,geco,3-869,I  can't  think  what  they're  after! 
3721,geco,3-870,"They've  been  in  every  room  in  the  house...turning  things  inside  out,  and  upside  down. "
3722,geco,3-871,It  really  is  too  bad! 
3723,geco,3-872,I  suppose  they  took  advantage  of  our  all  being  out. 
3724,geco,3-873,"I  shall  go  for  that  fellow  Japp,  when  I  next  see  him! "
3725,geco,3-874,"Lot  of  Paul  Prys,  grunted  Miss  Howard. "
3726,geco,3-875,Lawrence  opined  that  they  had  to  make  a  show  of  doing  something. 
3727,geco,3-876,Mary  Cavendish  said  nothing. 
3728,geco,3-877,"After  tea,  I  invited  Cynthia  to  come  for  a  walk,  and  we  sauntered  off  into  the  woods  together. "
3729,geco,3-878,Well? 
3730,geco,3-879,"I  inquired,  as  soon  as  we  were  protected  from  prying  eyes  by  the  leafy  screen. "
3731,geco,3-880,"With  a  sigh,  Cynthia  flung  herself  down,  and  tossed  off  her  hat. "
3732,geco,3-881,"The  sunlight,  piercing  through  the  branches,  turned  the  auburn  of  her  hair  to  quivering  gold. "
3733,geco,3-882,"Mr.  Hastings...you  are  always  so  kind,  and  you  know  such  a  lot. "
3734,geco,3-883,It  struck  me  at  this  moment  that  Cynthia  was  really  a  very  charming  girl! 
3735,geco,3-884,"Much  more  charming  than  Mary,  who  never  said  things  of  that  kind. "
3736,geco,3-885,"Well?  I  asked  benignantly,  as  she  hesitated. "
3737,geco,3-886,I  want  to  ask  your  advice. 
3738,geco,3-887,What  shall  I  do? 
3739,geco,3-888,Do? 
3740,geco,3-889,Yes. 
3741,geco,3-890,"You  see,  Aunt  Emily  always  told  me  I  should  be  provided  for. "
3742,geco,3-891,"I  suppose  she  forgot,  or  didn't  think  she  was  likely  to  die...anyway,  I  am  not  provided  for! "
3743,geco,3-892,And  I  don't  know  what  to  do. 
3744,geco,3-893,Do  you  think  I  ought  to  go  away  from  here  at  once? 
3745,geco,3-894,"Good  heavens,  no! "
3746,geco,3-895,"They  don't  want  to  part  with  you,  I'm  sure. "
3747,geco,3-896,"Cynthia  hesitated  a  moment,  plucking  up  the  grass  with  her  tiny  hands. "
3748,geco,3-897,Then  she  said:  Mr.s.  Cavendish  does. 
3749,geco,3-898,She  hates  me. 
3750,geco,3-899,"Hates  you?  I  cried,  astonished. "
3751,geco,3-900,Cynthia  nodded. 
3752,geco,3-901,Yes. 
3753,geco,3-902,"I  don't  know  why,  but  she  can't  bear  me;  and  he  can't,  either. "
3754,geco,3-903,"There  I  know  you're  wrong,  I  said  warmly. "
3755,geco,3-904,"On  the  contrary,  John  is  very  fond  of  you. "
3756,geco,3-905,"Oh,  yes...John. "
3757,geco,3-906,I  meant  Lawrence. 
3758,geco,3-907,"Not,  of  course,  that  I  care  whether  Lawrence  hates  me  or  not. "
3759,geco,3-908,"Still,  it's  rather  horrid  when  no  one  loves  you,  isn't  it? "
3760,geco,3-909,"But  they  do,  Cynthia  dear,  I  said  earnestly. "
3761,geco,3-910,I'm  sure  you  are  mistaken. 
3762,geco,3-911,"Look,  there  is  John...and  Miss  Howard... "
3763,geco,3-912,Cynthia nodded  rather  gloomily. 
3764,geco,3-913,"Yes,  John  likes  me,  I  think,  and  of  course  Evie,  for  all  her  gruff  ways,  wouldn't  be  unkind  to  a  fly. "
3765,geco,3-914,"But  Lawrence  never  speaks  to  me  if  he  can  help  it,  and  Mary  can  hardly  bring  herself  to  be  civil  to  me. "
3766,geco,3-915,"She  wants  Evie  to  stay  on,  is  begging  her  to,  but  she  doesn't  want  me,  and...and...I  don't  know  what  to  do. "
3767,geco,3-916,Suddenly  the  poor  child  burst  out  crying. 
3768,geco,3-917,I  don't  know  what  possessed  me. 
3769,geco,3-918,"Her  beauty,  perhaps,  as  she  sat  there,  with  the  sunlight  glinting  down  on  her  head;  perhaps  the  sense  of  relief  at  encountering  someone  who  so  obviously  could  have  no  connection  with  the  tragedy;  perhaps  honest  pity  for  her  youth  and  loneliness. "
3770,geco,3-919,"Anyway,  I  leant  forward,  and  taking  her  little  hand,  I  said  awkwardly:  Marry  me,  Cynthia. "
3771,geco,3-920,"Unwittingly,  I  had  hit  upon  a  sovereign  remedy  for  her  tears. "
3772,geco,3-921,"She  sat  up  at  once,  drew  her  hand  away,  and  said,  with  some  asperity:  Don't  be  silly! "
3773,geco,3-922,I  was  a  little  annoyed. 
3774,geco,3-923,I'm  not  being  silly. 
3775,geco,3-924,I  am  asking  you  to  do  me  the  honour  of  becoming  my  wife. 
3776,geco,3-925,"To  my  intense  surprise,  Cynthia  burst  out  laughing,  and  called  me  a  'funny  dear.' "
3777,geco,3-926,"It's  perfectly  sweet  of  you,  she  said,  but  you  know  you  don't  want  to! "
3778,geco,3-927,"Yes,  I  do. "
3779,geco,3-928,I've  got... 
3780,geco,3-929,Never mind  what  you've  got. 
3781,geco,3-930,You  don't  really  want  to...and  I  don't  either. 
3782,geco,3-931,"Well,  of  course,  that  settles  it,  I  said  stiffly. "
3783,geco,3-932,But  I  don't  see  anything  to  laugh  at. 
3784,geco,3-933,There's  nothing  funny  about  a  proposal. 
3785,geco,3-934,"No,  indeed,  said  Cynthia. "
3786,geco,3-935,Somebody  might  accept  you  next  time. 
3787,geco,3-936,"Good-bye,  you've  cheered  me  up  very  much. "
3788,geco,3-937,"And,  with  a  final  uncontrollable  burst  of  merriment,  she  vanished  through  the  trees. "
3789,geco,3-938,"Thinking  over  the  interview,  it  struck  me  as  being  profoundly  unsatisfactory. "
3790,geco,3-939,"It  occurred  to  me  suddenly  that  I  would  go  down  to  the  village,  and  look  up  Bauerstein. "
3791,geco,3-940,Somebody  ought  to  be  keeping  an  eye  on  the  fellow. 
3792,geco,3-941,"At  the  same  time,  it  would  be  wise  to  allay  any  suspicions  he  might  have  as  to  his  being  suspected. "
3793,geco,3-942,I  remembered  how  Poirot  had  relied  on  my  diplomacy. 
3794,geco,3-943,"Accordingly,  I  went  to  the  little  house  with  the  Apartments  card  inserted  in  the  window,  where  I  knew  he  lodged,  and  tapped  on  the  door. "
3795,geco,3-944,An  old  woman  came  and  opened  it. 
3796,geco,3-945,"Good  afternoon,  I  said  pleasantly. "
3797,geco,3-946,Is  Dr  Bauerstein  in? 
3798,geco,3-947,She  stared  at  me. 
3799,geco,3-948,Haven't  you  heard? 
3800,geco,3-949,Heard  what? 
3801,geco,3-950,About  him. 
3802,geco,3-951,What  about  him? 
3803,geco,3-952,He's  took. 
3804,geco,3-953,Took? 
3805,geco,3-954,Dead? 
3806,geco,3-955,"No,  took  by  the  perlice. "
3807,geco,3-956,By  the  police! 
3808,geco,3-957,I  gasped. 
3809,geco,3-958,Do  you  mean  they've  arrested  him? 
3810,geco,3-959,"Yes,  that's  it,  and... "
3811,geco,3-960,"I waited  to  hear  no  more,  but  tore  up  the  village  to  find  Poirot. "
3812,geco,3-961,"To  my  extreme  annoyance,  Poirot  was  not  in,  and  the  old  Belgian  who  answered  my  knock  informed  me  that  he  believed  he  had  gone  to  London. "
3813,geco,3-962,I  was  dumbfounded. 
3814,geco,3-963,What  on  earth  could  Poirot  be  doing  in  London! 
3815,geco,3-964,"Was  it  a  sudden  decision  on  his  part,  or  had  he  already  made  up  his  mind  when  he  parted  from  me  a  few  hours  earlier? "
3816,geco,3-965,I  retraced  my  steps  to  Styles  in  some  annoyance. 
3817,geco,3-966,"With  Poirot  away,  I  was  uncertain  how  to  act. "
3818,geco,3-967,Had  he  foreseen  this  arrest? 
3819,geco,3-968,"Had  he  not,  in  all  probability,  been  the  cause  of  it? "
3820,geco,3-969,Those  questions  I  could  not  resolve  But  in  the  meantime  what  was  I  to  do? 
3821,geco,3-970,"Should  I  announce  the  arrest  openly  at  Styles,  or  not? "
3822,geco,3-971,"Though  I  did  not  acknowledge  it  to  myself,  the  thought  of  Mary  Cavendish  was  weighing  on  me. "
3823,geco,3-972,Would  it  not  be  a  terrible  shock  to  her? 
3824,geco,3-973,"For  the  moment,  I  set  aside  utterly  any  suspicions  of  her. "
3825,geco,3-974,She  could  not  be  implicated...otherwise  I  should  have  heard  some  hint  of  it. 
3826,geco,3-975,"Of  course,  there  was  no  possibility  of  being  able  permanently  to  conceal  Dr  Bauerstein's  arrest  arrest  from  her. "
3827,geco,3-976,It  would  be  announced  in  every  newspaper  on  the  morrow. 
3828,geco,3-977,"Still,  I  shrank  from  blurting  blurting  it  out. "
3829,geco,3-978,"If  only  Poirot  had  been  accessible,  I  could  have  asked  his  advice. "
3830,geco,3-979,What  possessed  possessed  him  to  go  posting  off  to  London  in  this  unaccountable  way? 
3831,geco,3-980,"In  spite  of  myself,  my  opinion  of  his  sagacity  was  immeasurably  heightened. "
3832,geco,3-981,"I  would  never  have  dreamt  of  suspecting  the  the  doctor,  had  not  Poirot  put  it  into  my  head. "
3833,geco,3-982,"Yes,  decidedly,  the  little  man  was  clever. "
3834,geco,3-983,"After  some  reflecting,  I  decided  to  take  John  into  my  confidence,  and  leave  him  to  make  the  matter  public  or  not,  as  he  thought  fit. "
3835,geco,3-984,"He  gave  vent  to  a  prodigious  whistle,  as  I  imparted  the  news. "
3836,geco,3-985,Great  Scot! 
3837,geco,3-986,"You  were  right,  then. "
3838,geco,3-987,I  couldn't  believe  it  at  the  time. 
3839,geco,3-988,"No,  it  is  astonishing  until  you  get  used  to  the  idea,  and  see  how  it  makes  everything  fit  in. "
3840,geco,3-989,"Now,  what  are  we  to  do? "
3841,geco,3-990,"Of  course,  it  will  be  generally  known  tomorrow. "
3842,geco,3-991,John  reflected. 
3843,geco,3-992,"Never  mind,  he  said  at  last,  we  won't  say  anything  at  present. "
3844,geco,3-993,There  is  no  need. 
3845,geco,3-994,"As  you  say,  it  will  be  known  soon  enough. "
3846,geco,3-995,"But  to  my  intense  surprise,  on  getting  down  early  the  next  morning,  and  eagerly  opening  the  newspapers,  there  was  not  a  word  about  the  arrest! "
3847,geco,3-996,"There  was  a  column  of  mere  padding  about  The  Styles  Poisoning  Case,  but  nothing  further. "
3848,geco,3-997,"It  was  rather  inexplicable,  but  I  supposed  that,  for  some  reason  or  other,  Japp  wished  to  keep  it  out  of  the  papers. "
3849,geco,3-998,"It  worried  me  just  a  little,  for  it  suggested  the  possibility  that  there  might  be  further  arrests  to  come. "
3850,geco,3-999,"After  breakfast,  I  decided  to  go  down  to  the  village,  and  see  if  Poirot  had  returned  yet;  but,  before  I  could  start,  a  well-known  face  blocked  one  of  the  windows,  and  the  well-known  voice  said:  Bon  jour,  mon  ami! "
3851,geco,3-1000,"Poirot,  I  exclaimed,  with  relief,  and  seizing  him  by  both  hands,  I  dragged  him  into  the  room. "
3852,geco,3-1001,I  was  never  so  glad  to  see  anyone. 
3853,geco,3-1002,"Listen,  I  have  said  nothing  to  anybody  but  John. "
3854,geco,3-1003,Is  that  right? 
3855,geco,3-1004,"My  friend,  replied  Poirot,  I  do  not  know  what  you  are  talking  about. "
3856,geco,3-1005,"Dr  Bauerstein's  arrest,  of  course,  I  answered  impatiently. "
3857,geco,3-1006,"Is  Bauerstein  arrested,  then? "
3858,geco,3-1007,Did  you  not  know  it? 
3859,geco,3-1008,Not  the  least  in  the  world. 
3860,geco,3-1009,"But,  pausing  a  moment,  he  added:  Still,  it  does  not  surprise  me. "
3861,geco,3-1010,"After  all,  we  are  only  four  miles  from  the  coast. "
3862,geco,3-1011,"The  coast?  I  asked,  puzzled. "
3863,geco,3-1012,What  has  that  got  to  do  with  it? 
3864,geco,3-1013,Poirot  shrugged  his  shoulders. 
3865,geco,3-1014,"Surely,  it  is  obvious! "
3866,geco,3-1015,Not  to  me. 
3867,geco,3-1016,"No  doubt  I  am  very  dense,  but  I  cannot  see  what  the  proximity  of  the  coast  has  got  to  do  with  the  murder  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. "
3868,geco,3-1017,"Nothing  at  all,  of  course,  replied  Poirot,  smiling. "
3869,geco,3-1018,But  we  were  speaking  of  the  arrest  of  Dr  Bauerstein. 
3870,geco,3-1019,"Well,  he  is  arrested  for  the  murder  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp...... "
3871,geco,3-1020,"What? cried  Poirot,  in  apparently  lively  astonishment. "
3872,geco,3-1021,Dr  Bauerstein  arrested  for  the  murder  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp? 
3873,geco,3-1022,Yes. 
3874,geco,3-1023,Impossible! 
3875,geco,3-1024,That  would  be  too  good  a  farce! 
3876,geco,3-1025,"Who  told  you  that,  my  friend? "
3877,geco,3-1026,"Well,  no  one  exactly  told  me,  I  confessed. "
3878,geco,3-1027,But  he  is  arrested. 
3879,geco,3-1028,"Oh,  yes,  very  likely. "
3880,geco,3-1029,"But  for  espionage,  mon  ami. "
3881,geco,3-1030,Espionage? 
3882,geco,3-1031,I  gasped. 
3883,geco,3-1032,Precisely. 
3884,geco,3-1033,Not  for  poisoning  Mr.s.  Inglethorp? 
3885,geco,3-1034,"Not  unless  our  friend  Japp  has  taken  leave  of  his  senses,  replied  Poirot  placidly. "
3886,geco,3-1035,But...but  I  thought  you  thought  so  too? 
3887,geco,3-1036,"Poirot  gave  me  one  look,  which  conveyed  a  wondering  pity,  and  his  full  sense  of  the  utter  absurdity  of  such  an  idea. "
3888,geco,3-1037,"Do  you  mean  to  say,  I  asked,  slowly  adapting  myself  to  the  new  idea,  that  Dr  Bauerstein  is  a  spy? "
3889,geco,3-1038,Poirot  nodded. 
3890,geco,3-1039,Have  you  never  suspected  it? 
3891,geco,3-1040,It  never  entered  my  head. 
3892,geco,3-1041,"It  did  not  strike  you  as  peculiar  that  a  famous  London  doctor  should  bury  himself  in  a  little  village  like  this,  and  should  be  in  the  habit  of  walking  about  at  all  hours  of  the  night,  fully  dressed? "
3893,geco,3-1042,"No,  I  confessed,  I  never  thought  of  such  a  thing. "
3894,geco,3-1043,"He  is,  of  course,  a  German  by  birth,  said  Poirot  thoughtfully,  though  he  has  practiced  so  long  in  this  country  that  nobody  thinks  of  him  as  anything  but  an  Englishman. "
3895,geco,3-1044,He  was  naturalized  about  fifteen  years  ago. 
3896,geco,3-1045,"A  very  clever  man...a  Jew,  of  course. "
3897,geco,3-1046,The  blackguard!  I  cried  indignantly. 
3898,geco,3-1047,Not  at  all. 
3899,geco,3-1048,"He  is,  on  the  contrary,  a  patriot. "
3900,geco,3-1049,Think  what  he  stands  to  lose. 
3901,geco,3-1050,I  admire  the  man  myself. 
3902,geco,3-1051,But  I  could  not  look  at  it  in  Poirot's  philosophical  way. 
3903,geco,3-1052,And  this  is  the  man  with  whom  Mr.s.  Cavendish  has  been  wandering  about  all  over  the  country!  I  cried  indignantly. 
3904,geco,3-1053,Yes. 
3905,geco,3-1054,"I  should  fancy  he  had  found  her  very  useful,  remarked  Poirot. "
3906,geco,3-1055,"So  long  as  gossip  busied  itself  in  coupling  their  names  together,  any  other  vagaries  of  the  doctor's  passed  unobserved. "
3907,geco,3-1056,"Then  you  think  he  never  really  cared  for  her?  I  asked  eagerly...rather  too  eagerly,  perhaps,  under  the  circumstances. "
3908,geco,3-1057,"That,  of  course,  I  cannot  say,  but...shall  I  tell  you  my  own  private  opinion,  Hastings? "
3909,geco,3-1058,Yes. 
3910,geco,3-1059,"Well,  it  is  this:  that  Mr.s.  Cavendish  does  not  care,  and  never  has  cared  one  little  jot  about  Dr  Bauerstein! "
3911,geco,3-1060,Do  you  really  think  so? 
3912,geco,3-1061,I  could  not  disguise  my  pleasure. 
3913,geco,3-1062,I  am  quite  sure  of  it. 
3914,geco,3-1063,And  I  will  tell  you  why. 
3915,geco,3-1064,Yes? 
3916,geco,3-1065,"Because  she  cares  for  some  one  else,  mon  ami. "
3917,geco,3-1066,Oh! 
3918,geco,3-1067,What  did  he  mean? 
3919,geco,3-1068,"In  spite  of  myself,  an  agreeable  warmth  spread  over  me. "
3920,geco,3-1069,"I  am  not  a  vain  man  where  women  are  concerned,  but  I  remembered  certain  evidences,  too  lightly  thought  of  at  the  time,  perhaps,  but  which  certainly  seemed  to  indicate...... "
3921,geco,3-1070,My pleasing  thoughts  were  interrupted  by  the  sudden  entrance  of  Miss  Howard. 
3922,geco,3-1071,"She  glanced  round  hastily  to  make  sure  there  was  no  one  else  in  the  room,  and  quickly  produced  an  old  sheet  of  brown  paper. "
3923,geco,3-1072,"This  she  handed  to  Poirot,  murmuring  as  she  did  so  the  cryptic  words:  On  top  of  the  wardrobe. "
3924,geco,3-1073,Then  she  hurriedly  left  the  room. 
3925,geco,3-1074,"Poirot  unfolded  the  sheet  of  paper  eagerly,  and  uttered  an  exclamation  of  satisfaction. "
3926,geco,3-1075,He  spread  it  out  on  the  table. 
3927,geco,3-1076,"Come  here,  Hastings. "
3928,geco,3-1077,"Now  tell  me,  what  is  that  initial...J. "
3929,geco,3-1078,or  L.? 
3930,geco,3-1079,"It  was  a  medium  sized  sheet  of  paper,  rather  dusty,  as  though  it  had  lain  by  for  some  time. "
3931,geco,3-1080,But  it  was  the  label  that  was  attracting  Poirot's  attention. 
3932,geco,3-1081,"At  the  top,  it  bore  the  printed  stamp  of  Messrs. "
3933,geco,3-1082,"Parkson's,  the  well-known  theatrical  costumiers,  and  it  was  addressed  to  ...(the  debatable  initial)  Cavendish,  Esq., "
3934,geco,3-1083,"Styles  Court,  Styles  St. "
3935,geco,3-1084,"Mary,  Essex. "
3936,geco,3-1085,"It  might  be  T., "
3937,geco,3-1086,"or  it  might  be  L., "
3938,geco,3-1087,"I  said,  after  studying  the  thing  for  a  minute  or  two. "
3939,geco,3-1088,It  certainly  isn't  a  J. 
3940,geco,3-1089,"Good,  replied  Poirot,  folding  up  the  paper  again. "
3941,geco,3-1090,"I,  also,  am  of  your  way  of  thinking. "
3942,geco,3-1091,"It  is  an  L., "
3943,geco,3-1092,depend  upon  it! 
3944,geco,3-1093,Where  did  it  come  from?  I  asked  curiously. 
3945,geco,3-1094,Is  it  important? 
3946,geco,3-1095,Moderately  so. 
3947,geco,3-1096,It  confirms  a  surmise  of  mine. 
3948,geco,3-1097,"Having  deduced  its  existence,  I  set  Miss  Howard  to  search  for  it,  and,  as  you  see,  she  has  been  successful. "
3949,geco,3-1098,What  did  she  mean  by  'On  the  top  of  the  wardrobe'? 
3950,geco,3-1099,"She  meant,  replied  Poirot  promptly,  that  she  found  it  on  top  of  a  wardrobe. "
3951,geco,3-1100,"A  funny  place  for  a  piece  of  brown  paper,  I  mused. "
3952,geco,3-1101,Not  at  all. 
3953,geco,3-1102,The  top  of  a  wardrobe  is  an  excellent  place  for  brown  paper  and  cardboard  boxes. 
3954,geco,3-1103,I  have  kept  them  there  myself. 
3955,geco,3-1104,"Neatly  arranged,  there  is  nothing  to  offend  the  eye. "
3956,geco,3-1105,"Poirot,  I  asked  earnestly,  have  you  made  up  your  mind  about  this  crime? "
3957,geco,3-1106,"Yes...that  is  to  say,  I  believe  I  know  how  it  was  committed. "
3958,geco,3-1107,Ah! 
3959,geco,3-1108,"Unfortunately,  I  have  no  proof  beyond  my  surmise,  unless...... "
3960,geco,3-1109,"With sudden  energy,  he  caught  me  by  the  arm,  and  whirled  me  down  the  hall,  calling  out  in  French  in  his  excitement:  Mademoiselle  Dorcas,  Mademoiselle  Dorcas,  un  moment,  s'il  vous  plait! "
3961,geco,3-1110,"Dorcas,  quite  flurried  by  the  noise,  came  hurrying  out  of  the  pantry. "
3962,geco,3-1111,"My  good  Dorcas,  I  have  an  idea...a  little  idea...if  it  should  prove  justified,  what  magnificent  chance! "
3963,geco,3-1112,"Tell  me,  on  Monday,  not  Tuesday,  Dorcas,  but  Monday,  the  day  before  the  tragedy,  did  anything  go  wrong  with  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  bell? "
3964,geco,3-1113,Dorcas  looked  very  surprised. 
3965,geco,3-1114,"Yes,  sir,  now  you  mention  it,  it  did;  though  I  don't  know  how  you  came  to  hear  of  it. "
3966,geco,3-1115,"A  mouse,  or  some  such,  must  have  nibbled  the  wire  through. "
3967,geco,3-1116,The  man  came  and  put  it  right  on  Tuesday  morning. 
3968,geco,3-1117,"With  a  long  drawn  exclamation  of  ecstasy,  Poirot  led  the  way  back  to  the  morning-room. "
3969,geco,3-1118,"See  you,  one  should  not  ask  for  outside  proof...no,  reason  should  be  enough. "
3970,geco,3-1119,"But  the  flesh  is  weak,  it  is  consolation  to  find  that  one  is  on  the  right  track. "
3971,geco,3-1120,"Ah,  my  friend,  I  am  like  a  giant  refreshed. "
3972,geco,3-1121,I  run! 
3973,geco,3-1122,I  leap! 
3974,geco,3-1123,"And,  in  very  truth,  run  and  leap  he  did,  gambolling  wildly  down  the  stretch  of  lawn  outside  the  long  window. "
3975,geco,3-1124,"What  is  your  remarkable  little  friend  doing?  asked  a  voice  behind  me,  and  I  turned  to  find  Mary  Cavendish  at  my  elbow. "
3976,geco,3-1125,"She  smiled,  and  so  did  I. "
3977,geco,3-1126,What  is  it  all  about? 
3978,geco,3-1127,"Really,  I  can't  tell  you. "
3979,geco,3-1128,"He  asked  Dorcas  some  question  about  a  bell,  and  appeared  so  delighted  with  her  answer  that  he  is  capering  about  as  you  see! "
3980,geco,3-1129,Mary  laughed. 
3981,geco,3-1130,How  ridiculous! 
3982,geco,3-1131,He's  going  out  of  the  gate. 
3983,geco,3-1132,Isn't  he  coming  back  today? 
3984,geco,3-1133,I  don't  know. 
3985,geco,3-1134,I've  given  up  trying  to  guess  what  he'll  do  next. 
3986,geco,3-1135,"Is  he  quite  mad,  Mr.  Hastings? "
3987,geco,3-1136,I  honestly  don't  know. 
3988,geco,3-1137,"Sometimes,  I  feel  sure  he  is  as  mad  as  a  hatter;  and  then,  just  as  he  is  at  his  maddest,  I  find  there  is  method  in  his  madness. "
3989,geco,3-1138,I  see. 
3990,geco,3-1139,"In  spite  of  her  laugh,  Mary  was  looking  thoughtful  this  morning. "
3991,geco,3-1140,"She  seemed  grave,  almost  sad. "
3992,geco,3-1141,It  occurred  to  me  that  it  would  be  a  good  opportunity  to  tackle  her  on  the  subject  of  Cynthia. 
3993,geco,3-1142,"I  began  rather  tactfully,  I  thought,  but  I  had  not  gone  far  before  she  stopped  me  authoritatively. "
3994,geco,3-1143,"You  are  an  excellent  advocate,  I  have  no  doubt,  Mr.  Hastings,  but  in  this  case  your  talents  are  quite  thrown  away. "
3995,geco,3-1144,Cynthia  will  run  no  risk  of  encountering  any  unkindness  from  me. 
3996,geco,3-1145,"I  began  to  stammer  feebly  that  I  hoped  she  hadn't  thought...But  again  she  stopped  me,  and  her  words  were  so  unexpected  that  they  quite  drove  Cynthia,  and  her  troubles,  out  of  my  mind. "
3997,geco,3-1146,"Mr.  Hastings,  she  said,  do  you  think  I  and  my  husband  are  happy  together? "
3998,geco,3-1147,"I  was  considerably  taken  aback,  and  murmured  something  about  it's  not  being  my  business  to  think  anything  of  the  sort. "
3999,geco,3-1148,"Well,  she  said  quietly,  whether  it  is  your  business  or  not,  I  will  tell  you  that  we  are  not  happy. "
4000,geco,3-1149,"I  said  nothing,  for  I  saw  that  she  had  not  finished. "
4001,geco,3-1150,"She  began  slowly,  walking  up  and  down  the  room,  her  head  a  little  bent,  and  that  slim,  supple  figure  of  hers  swaying  gently  as  she  walked. "
4002,geco,3-1151,"She  stopped  suddenly,  and  looked  up  at  me. "
4003,geco,3-1152,"You  don't  know  anything  about  me,  do  you?  she  asked. "
4004,geco,3-1153,"Where  I  come  from,  who  I  was  before  I  married  John...anything,  in  fact? "
4005,geco,3-1154,"Well,  I  will  tell  you. "
4006,geco,3-1155,I  will  make  a  father  confessor  of  you. 
4007,geco,3-1156,"You  are  kind,  I  think...yes,  I  am  sure  you  are  kind. "
4008,geco,3-1157,"Somehow,  I  was  not  quite  as  elated  as  I  might  have  been. "
4009,geco,3-1158,I  remembered  that  Cynthia  had  begun  her  confidences  in  much  the  same  way. 
4010,geco,3-1159,"Besides,  a  father  confessor  should  be  elderly,  it  is  not  at  all  the  role  for  a  young  man. "
4011,geco,3-1160,"My  father  was  English,  said  Mr.s.  Cavendish,  but  my  mother  was  a  Russian. "
4012,geco,3-1161,"Ah,  I  said,  now  I  understand... "
4013,geco,3-1162,Understand what? 
4014,geco,3-1163,A  hint  of  something  foreign...different...that  there  has  always  been  about  you. 
4015,geco,3-1164,"My  mother  was  very  beautiful,  I  believe. "
4016,geco,3-1165,"I  don't  know,  because  I  never  saw  her. "
4017,geco,3-1166,She  died  when  I  was  quite  a  little  child. 
4018,geco,3-1167,I  believe  there  was  some  tragedy  connected  with  her  death...she  took  an  overdose  of  some  sleeping  draught  by  mistake. 
4019,geco,3-1168,"However  that  may  be,  my  father  was  broken-hearted. "
4020,geco,3-1169,"Shortly  afterwards,  he  went  into  the  Consular  Service. "
4021,geco,3-1170,"Everywhere  he  went,  I  went  with  him. "
4022,geco,3-1171,"When  I  was  twenty-three,  I  had  been  nearly  all  over  the  world. "
4023,geco,3-1172,It  was  a  splendid  life...I  loved  it. 
4024,geco,3-1173,"There  was  a  smile  on  her  face,  and  her  head  was  thrown  back. "
4025,geco,3-1174,She  seemed  living  in  the  memory  of  those  old  glad  days. 
4026,geco,3-1175,Then  my  father  died. 
4027,geco,3-1176,He  left  me  very  badly  off. 
4028,geco,3-1177,I  had  to  go  and  live  with  some  old  aunts  in  Yorkshire. 
4029,geco,3-1178,She  shuddered. 
4030,geco,3-1179,You  will  understand  me  when  I  say  that  it  was  a  deadly  life  for  a  girl  brought  up  as  I  had  been. 
4031,geco,3-1180,"The  narrowness,  the  deadly  monotony  of  it,  almost  drove  me  mad. "
4032,geco,3-1181,"She  paused  a  minute,  and  added  in  a  different  tone:  And  then  I  met  John  Cavendish. "
4033,geco,3-1182,Yes? 
4034,geco,3-1183,"You  can  imagine  that,  from  my  aunts'  point  of  view,  it  was  a  very  good  match  for  me. "
4035,geco,3-1184,But  I  can  honestly  say  it  was  not  this  fact  which  weighed  with  me. 
4036,geco,3-1185,"No,  he  was  simply  a  way  of  escape  from  the  insufferable  monotony  of  my  life. "
4037,geco,3-1186,"I  said  nothing,  and  after  a  moment,  she  went  on:  Don't  misunderstand  me. "
4038,geco,3-1187,I  was  quite  honest  with  him. 
4039,geco,3-1188,"I  told  him,  what  was  true,  that  I  liked  him  very  much,  that  I  hoped  to  come  to  like  him  more,  but  that  I  was  not  in  any  way  what  the  world  calls  'in  love'  with  him. "
4040,geco,3-1189,"He  declared  that  that  satisfied  him,  and  so...we  were  married. "
4041,geco,3-1190,"She  waited  a  long  time,  a  little  frown  had  gathered  on  her  forehead. "
4042,geco,3-1191,She  seemed  to  be  looking  back  earnestly  into  those  past  days. 
4043,geco,3-1192,I  think...I  am  sure...he  cared  for  me  at  first. 
4044,geco,3-1193,But  I  suppose  we  were  not  well  matched. 
4045,geco,3-1194,"Almost  at  once,  we  drifted  apart. "
4046,geco,3-1195,"He...it  is  not  a  pleasing  thing  for  my  pride,  but  it  is  the  truth...tired  of  me  very  soon. "
4047,geco,3-1196,"I  must  have  made  some  murmur  of  dissent,  for  she  went  on  quickly:  Oh,  yes,  he  did! "
4048,geco,3-1197,Not  that  it  matters  now...now  that  we've  come  to  the  parting  of  the  ways. 
4049,geco,3-1198,What  do  you  mean? 
4050,geco,3-1199,She  answered  quietly:  I  mean  that  I  am  not  going  to  remain  at  Styles. 
4051,geco,3-1200,You  and  John  are  not  going  to  live  here? 
4052,geco,3-1201,"John  may  live  here,  but  I  shall  not. "
4053,geco,3-1202,You  are  going  to  leave  him? 
4054,geco,3-1203,Yes. 
4055,geco,3-1204,But  why? 
4056,geco,3-1205,"She  paused  a  long  time,  and  said  at  last:  Perhaps...because  I  want  to  be...free! "
4057,geco,3-1206,"And,  as  she  spoke,  I  had  a  sudden  vision  of  broad  spaces,  virgin  tracts  of  forests,  untrodden  lands...and  a  realization  of  what  freedom  would  mean  to  such  a  nature  as  Mary  Cavendish. "
4058,geco,3-1207,"I  seemed  to  see  her  for  a  moment  as  she  was,  a  proud  wild  creature,  as  untamed  by  civilization  as  some  shy  bird  of  the  hills. "
4059,geco,3-1208,"A  little  cry  broke  from  her  lips:  You  don't  know,  you  don't  know,  how  this  hateful  place  has  been  prison  to  me! "
4060,geco,3-1209,"I  understand,  I  said,  but...but  don't  do  anything  rash. "
4061,geco,3-1210,"Oh,  rash! "
4062,geco,3-1211,Her  voice  mocked  at  my  prudence. 
4063,geco,3-1212,Then  suddenly  I  said  a  thing  I  could  have  bitten  out  my  tongue  for:  You  know  that  Dr  Bauerstein  has  been  arrested? 
4064,geco,3-1213,"An  instant  coldness  passed  like  a  mask  over  her  face,  blotting  out  all  expression. "
4065,geco,3-1214,John  was  so  kind  as  to  break  that  to  me  this  morning. 
4066,geco,3-1215,"Well,  what  do  you  think?  I  asked  feebly. "
4067,geco,3-1216,Of  what? 
4068,geco,3-1217,Of  the  arrest? 
4069,geco,3-1218,What  should  I  think? 
4070,geco,3-1219,Apparently  he  is  a  German  spy;  so  the  gardener  had  told  John. 
4071,geco,3-1220,Her  face  and  voice  were  absolutely  cold  and  expressionless. 
4072,geco,3-1221,"Did  she  care,  or  did  she  not? "
4073,geco,3-1222,"She  moved  away  a  step  or  two,  and  fingered  one  of  the  flower  vases. "
4074,geco,3-1223,These  are  quite  dead. 
4075,geco,3-1224,I  must  do  them  again. 
4076,geco,3-1225,"Would  you  mind  moving...thank  you,  Mr.  Hastings. "
4077,geco,3-1226,"And  she  walked  quietly  past  me  out  of  the  window,  with  a  cool  little  nod  of  dismissal. "
4078,geco,3-1227,"No,  surely  she  could  not  care  for  Bauerstein. "
4079,geco,3-1228,No  woman  could  act  her  part  with  that  icy  unconcern. 
4080,geco,3-1229,"Poirot  did  not  make  his  appearance  the  following  morning,  and  there  was  no  sign  of  the  Scotland  Yard  men. "
4081,geco,3-1230,"But,  at  lunch-time,  there  arrived  a  new  piece  of  evidence...or  rather  lack  of  evidence. "
4082,geco,3-1231,"We  had  vainly  tried  to  trace  the  fourth  letter,  which  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  written  on  the  evening  preceding  her  death. "
4083,geco,3-1232,"Our  efforts  having  been  in  vain,  we  had  abandoned  the  matter,  hoping  that  it  might  turn  up  of  itself  one  day. "
4084,geco,3-1233,"And  this  is  just  what  did  happen,  in  the  shape  of  a  communication,  which  arrived  by  the  second  post  from  a  firm  of  French  music  publishers,  acknowledging  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  cheque,  and  regretting  they  had  been  unable  to  trace  a  certain  series  of  Russian  folksongs. "
4085,geco,3-1234,"So  the  last  hope  of  solving  the  mystery,  by  means  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  correspondence  on  the  fatal  evening,  had  to  be  abandoned. "
4086,geco,3-1235,"Just  before  tea,  I  strolled  down  to  tell  Poirot  of  the  new  disappointment,  but  found,  to  my  annoyance,  that  he  was  once  more  out. "
4087,geco,3-1236,Gone  to  London  again? 
4088,geco,3-1237,"Oh,  no,  monsieur,  he  has  but  taken  the  train  to  Tadminster. "
4089,geco,3-1238,"'To  see  a  young  lady's  dispensary,'  he  said. "
4090,geco,3-1239,Silly  ass! 
4091,geco,3-1240,I  ejaculated. 
4092,geco,3-1241,I  told  him  Wednesday  was  the  one  day  she  wasn't  there! 
4093,geco,3-1242,"Well,  tell  him  to  look  us  up  tomorrow  morning,  will  you? "
4094,geco,3-1243,"Certainly,  monsieur. "
4095,geco,3-1244,"But,  on  the  following  day,  no  sign  of  Poirot. "
4096,geco,3-1245,I  was  getting  angry. 
4097,geco,3-1246,He  was  really  treating  us  in  the  most  cavalier  fashion. 
4098,geco,3-1247,"After  lunch,  Lawrence  drew  me  aside,  and  asked  if  I  was  going  down  to  see  him. "
4099,geco,3-1248,"No,  I  don't  think  I  shall. "
4100,geco,3-1249,He  can  come  up  here  if  he  wants  to  see  us. 
4101,geco,3-1250,Oh! 
4102,geco,3-1251,Lawrence  looked  indeterminate. 
4103,geco,3-1252,Something  unusually  nervous  and  excited  in  his  manner  roused  my  curiosity. 
4104,geco,3-1253,What  is  it?  I  asked. 
4105,geco,3-1254,I  could  go  if  there's  anything  special. 
4106,geco,3-1255,"It's  nothing  much,  but...well,  if  you  are  going,  will  you  tell  him...  he  dropped  his  voice  to  a  whisper... I  think  I've  found  the  extra  coffee-cup! "
4107,geco,3-1256,"I  had  almost  forgotten  that  enigmatical  message  of  Poirot's,  but  now  my  curiosity  was  aroused  afresh. "
4108,geco,3-1257,"Lawrence  would  say  no  more,  so  I  decided  that  I  would  descend  from  my  high  horse,  and  once  more  seek  out  Poirot  at  Leastways  Cottage. "
4109,geco,3-1258,This  time  I  was  received  with  a  smile. 
4110,geco,3-1259,Monsieur  Poirot  was  within. 
4111,geco,3-1260,Would  I  mount? 
4112,geco,3-1261,I  mounted  accordingly. 
4113,geco,3-1262,"Poirot  was  sitting  by  the  table,  his  head  buried  in  his  hands. "
4114,geco,3-1263,He  sprang  up  at  my  entrance. 
4115,geco,3-1264,What  is  it?  I  asked  solicitously. 
4116,geco,3-1265,"You  are  not  ill,  I  trust? "
4117,geco,3-1266,"No,  no,  not  ill. "
4118,geco,3-1267,But  I  decide  an  affair  of  great  moment. 
4119,geco,3-1268,Whether  to  catch  the  criminal  or  not?  I  asked  facetiously. 
4120,geco,3-1269,"But,  to  my  great  surprise,  Poirot  nodded  gravely. "
4121,geco,3-1270,"'To  speak  or  not  to  speak,'  as  your  so  great  Shakespeare  says,  'that  is  the  question.' "
4122,geco,3-1271,I  did  not  trouble  to  correct  the  quotation. 
4123,geco,3-1272,"You  are  not  serious,  Poirot? "
4124,geco,3-1273,I  am  of  the  most  serious. 
4125,geco,3-1274,For  the  most  serious  of  all  things  hangs  in  the  balance. 
4126,geco,3-1275,And  that  is? 
4127,geco,3-1276,"A  woman's  happiness,  mon  ami,  he  said  gravely. "
4128,geco,3-1277,I  did  not  quite  know  what  to  say. 
4129,geco,3-1278,"The  moment  has  come,  said  Poirot  thoughtfully,  and  I  do  not  know  what  to  do. "
4130,geco,3-1279,"For,  see  you,  it  is  a  big  stake  for  which  I  play. "
4131,geco,3-1280,"No  one  but  I,  Hercule  Poirot,  would  attempt  it! "
4132,geco,3-1281,And  he  tapped  himself  proudly  on  the  breast. 
4133,geco,3-1282,"After  pausing  a  few  minutes  respectfully,  so  as  not  to  spoil  his  effect,  I  gave  him  Lawrence's  message. "
4134,geco,3-1283,Aha!  he  cried. 
4135,geco,3-1284,So  he  has  found  the  extra  coffee-cup. 
4136,geco,3-1285,That  is  good. 
4137,geco,3-1286,"He  has  more  intelligence  than  would  appear,  this  long-faced  Monsieur  Lawrence  of  yours! "
4138,geco,3-1287,"I  did  not  myself  think  very  highly  of  Lawrence's  intelligence;  but  I  forebore  to  contradict  Poirot,  and  gently  took  him  to  task  for  forgetting  my  instructions  as  to  which  were  Cynthia's  days  off. "
4139,geco,3-1288,It  is  true. 
4140,geco,3-1289,I  have  the  head  of  a  sieve. 
4141,geco,3-1290,"However,  the  other  young  lady  was  most  kind. "
4142,geco,3-1291,"She  was  sorry  for  my  disappointment,  and  showed  me  everything  in  the  kindest  way. "
4143,geco,3-1292,"Oh,  well,  that's  all  right,  then,  and  you  must  go  to  tea  with  Cynthia  another  day. "
4144,geco,3-1293,I  told  him  about  the  letter. 
4145,geco,3-1294,"I  am  sorry  for  that,  he  said. "
4146,geco,3-1295,I  always  had  hopes  of  that  letter. 
4147,geco,3-1296,"But  no,  it  was  not  to  be. "
4148,geco,3-1297,This  affair  must  all  be  unravelled  from  within. 
4149,geco,3-1298,He  tapped  his  forehead. 
4150,geco,3-1299,These  little  grey  cells. 
4151,geco,3-1300,It  is  'up  to  them'...as  you  say  over  here. 
4152,geco,3-1301,"Then,  suddenly,  he  asked:  Are  you  a  judge  of  finger-marks,  my  friend? "
4153,geco,3-1302,"No,  I  said,  rather  surprised,  I  know  that  there  are  no  two  finger-marks  alike,  but  that's  as  far  as  my  science  goes. "
4154,geco,3-1303,Exactly. 
4155,geco,3-1304,"He  unlocked  a  little  drawer,  and  took  out  some  photographs  which  he  laid  on  the  table. "
4156,geco,3-1305,"I  have  numbered  them,  1 2 3. "
4157,geco,3-1306,Will  you  describe  them  to  me? 
4158,geco,3-1307,I  studied  the  proofs  attentively. 
4159,geco,3-1308,"All  greatly  magnified,  I  see. "
4160,geco,3-1309,No. 
4161,geco,3-1310,"1 I  should  say,  are  a  man's  finger-prints;  thumb  and  first  finger. "
4162,geco,3-1311,No. 
4163,geco,3-1312,"2 are  a  lady's;  they  are  much  smaller,  and  quite  different  in  every  way. "
4164,geco,3-1313,"3 ...I  paused  for  some  time... there  seem  to  be  a  lot  of  confused  finger-marks,  but  here,  very  distinctly,  are  No. "
4165,geco,3-1314,1's. 
4166,geco,3-1315,Overlapping  the  others? 
4167,geco,3-1316,Yes. 
4168,geco,3-1317,You  recognize  them  beyond  fail? 
4169,geco,3-1318,"Oh,  yes;  they  are  identical. "
4170,geco,3-1319,"Poirot  nodded,  and  gently  taking  the  photographs  from  me  locked  them  up  again. "
4171,geco,3-1320,"I  suppose,  I  said,  that  as  usual,  you  are  not  going  to  explain? "
4172,geco,3-1321,On  the  contrary. 
4173,geco,3-1322,No. 
4174,geco,3-1323,1 were  the  finger-prints  of  Monsieur  Lawrence. 
4175,geco,3-1324,No. 
4176,geco,3-1325,2 were  those  of  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. 
4177,geco,3-1326,They  are  not  important. 
4178,geco,3-1327,I  merely  obtained  them  for  comparison. 
4179,geco,3-1328,No. 
4180,geco,3-1329,3 is  a  little  more  complicated. 
4181,geco,3-1330,Yes? 
4182,geco,3-1331,"It  is,  as  you  see,  highly  magnified. "
4183,geco,3-1332,You  may  have  noticed  a  sort  of  blur  extending  all  across  the  picture. 
4184,geco,3-1333,"I  will  not  describe  to  you  the  special  apparatus,  dusting  powder,  etc., "
4185,geco,3-1334,which  I  used. 
4186,geco,3-1335,"It  is  a  well-known  process  to  the  police,  and  by  means  of  it  you  can  obtain  a  photograph  of  the  finger-prints  of  any  object  in  a  very  short  space  of  time. "
4187,geco,3-1336,"Well,  my  friend,  you  have  seen  the  finger-marks...it  remains  to  tell  you  the  particular  object  on  which  they  had  been  left. "
4188,geco,3-1337,Go  on...I  am  really  excited. 
4189,geco,3-1338,Eh  bien! 
4190,geco,3-1339,Photo  No. 
4191,geco,3-1340,3 represents  the  highly  magnified  surface  of  a  tiny  bottle  in  the  top  poison  cupboard  of  the  dispensary  in  the  Red  Cross  Hospital  at  Tadminster...which  sounds  like  the  house  that  Jack  built! 
4192,geco,3-1341,Good  heavens! 
4193,geco,3-1342,I  exclaimed. 
4194,geco,3-1343,But  what  were  Lawrence  Cavendish's  finger-marks  doing  on  it? 
4195,geco,3-1344,He  never  went  near  the  poison  cupboard  the  day  we  were  there! 
4196,geco,3-1345,"Oh,  yes,  he  did! "
4197,geco,3-1346,Impossible! 
4198,geco,3-1347,We  were  all  together  the  whole  time. 
4199,geco,3-1348,Poirot  shook  his  head. 
4200,geco,3-1349,"No,  my  friend,  there  was  a  moment  when  you  were  not  all  together. "
4201,geco,3-1350,"There  was  a  moment  when  you  could  not  have  been  all  together,  or  it  would  not  have  been  necessary  to  call  to  Monsieur  Lawrence  to  come  and  join  you  on  the  balcony. "
4202,geco,3-1351,"I'd  forgotten  that,  I  admitted. "
4203,geco,3-1352,But  it  was  only  for  a  moment. 
4204,geco,3-1353,Long  enough. 
4205,geco,3-1354,Long  enough  for  what? 
4206,geco,3-1355,Poirot's  smile  became  rather  enigmatical. 
4207,geco,3-1356,Long  enough  for  a  gentleman  who  had  once  studied  medicine  to  gratify  a  very  natural  interest  and  curiosity. 
4208,geco,3-1357,Our  eyes  met. 
4209,geco,3-1358,Poirot's  were  pleasantly  vague. 
4210,geco,3-1359,He  got  up  and  hummed  a  little  tune. 
4211,geco,3-1360,I  watched  him  suspiciously. 
4212,geco,3-1361,"Poirot,  I  said,  what  was  in  this  particular  little  bottle? "
4213,geco,3-1362,Poirot  looked  out  of  the  window. 
4214,geco,3-1363,"Hydro-chloride  of  strychnine,  he  said,  over  his  shoulder,  continuing  to  hum. "
4215,geco,3-1364,Good  heavens! 
4216,geco,3-1365,I  said  it  quite  quietly. 
4217,geco,3-1366,I  was  not  surprised. 
4218,geco,3-1367,I  had  expected  that  answer. 
4219,geco,3-1368,They  use  the  pure  hydro-chloride  of  strychnine  very  little...only  occasionally  for  pills. 
4220,geco,3-1369,"It  is  the  official  solution,  Liq. "
4221,geco,3-1370,Strychnine  Hydro-clor. 
4222,geco,3-1371,that  is  used  in  most  medicines. 
4223,geco,3-1372,That  is  why  the  finger-marks  have  remained  undisturbed  since  then. 
4224,geco,3-1373,How  did  you  manage  to  take  this  photograph? 
4225,geco,3-1374,"I  dropped  my  hat  from  the  balcony,  explained  Poirot  simply. "
4226,geco,3-1375,"Visitors  were  not  permitted  below  at  that  hour,  so,  in  spite  of  my  many  apologies,  Mademoiselle  Cynthia's  colleague  had  to  go  down  and  fetch  it  for  me. "
4227,geco,3-1376,Then  you  knew  what  you  were  going  to  find? 
4228,geco,3-1377,"No,  not  at  all. "
4229,geco,3-1378,"I  merely  realized  that  it  was  possible,  from  your  story,  for  Monsieur  Lawrence  to  go  to  the  poison  cupboard. "
4230,geco,3-1379,"The  possibility  had  to  be  confirmed,  or  eliminated. "
4231,geco,3-1380,"Poirot,  I  said,  your  gaiety  does  not  deceive  me. "
4232,geco,3-1381,This  is  a  very  important  discovery. 
4233,geco,3-1382,"I  do  not  know,  said  Poirot. "
4234,geco,3-1383,But  one  thing  does  strike  me. 
4235,geco,3-1384,No  doubt  it  has  struck  you  too. 
4236,geco,3-1385,What  is  that? 
4237,geco,3-1386,"Why,  that  there  is  altogether  too  much  strychnine  about  this  case. "
4238,geco,3-1387,This  is  the  third  time  we  run  up  against  it. 
4239,geco,3-1388,There  was  strychnine  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  tonic. 
4240,geco,3-1389,There  is  the  strychnine  sold  across  the  counter  at  Styles  St. 
4241,geco,3-1390,Mary  by  Mace. 
4242,geco,3-1391,"Now  we  have  more  strychnine,  handled  by  one  of  the  household. "
4243,geco,3-1392,"It  is  confusing;  and,  as  you  know,  I  do  not  like  confusion. "
4244,geco,3-1393,"Before  I  could  reply,  one  of  the  other  Belgians  opened  the  door  and  stuck  his  head  in. "
4245,geco,3-1394,"There  is  a  lady  below,  asking  for  Mr.  Hastings. "
4246,geco,3-1395,A  lady? 
4247,geco,3-1396,I  jumped  up. 
4248,geco,3-1397,Poirot  followed  me  down  the  narrow  stairs. 
4249,geco,3-1398,Mary  Cavendish  was  standing  in  the  doorway. 
4250,geco,3-1399,"I  have  been  visiting  an  old  woman  in  the  village,  she  explained,  and  as  Lawrence  told  me  you  were  with  Monsieur  Poirot  I  thought  I  would  call  for  you. "
4251,geco,3-1400,"Alas,  madame,  said  Poirot,  I  thought  you  had  come  to  honour  me  with  a  visit! "
4252,geco,3-1401,"I  will  some  day,  if  you  ask  me,  she  promised  him,  smiling. "
4253,geco,3-1402,That  is  well. 
4254,geco,3-1403,"If  you  should  need  a  father  confessor,  madame  ...she  started  ever  so  slightly... remember,  Papa  Poirot  is  always  at  your  service. "
4255,geco,3-1404,"She  stared  at  him  for  a  few  minutes,  as  though  seeking  to  read  some  deeper  meaning  into  his  words. "
4256,geco,3-1405,Then  she  turned  abruptly  away. 
4257,geco,3-1406,"Come,  will  you  not  walk  back  with  us  too,  Monsieur  Poirot? "
4258,geco,3-1407,"Enchanted,  madame. "
4259,geco,3-1408,"All  the  way  to  Styles,  Mary  talked  fast  and  feverishly. "
4260,geco,3-1409,It  struck  me  that  in  some  way  she  was  nervous  of  Poirot's  eyes. 
4261,geco,3-1410,"The  weather  had  broken,  and  the  sharp  wind  was  almost  autumnal  in  its  shrewishness. "
4262,geco,3-1411,"Mary  shivered  a  little,  and  buttoned  her  black  sports  coat  closer. "
4263,geco,3-1412,"The  wind  through  the  trees  made  a  mournful  noise,  like  some  great  giant  sighing. "
4264,geco,3-1413,"We  walked  up  to  the  great  door  of  Styles,  and  at  once  the  knowledge  came  to  us  that  something  was  wrong. "
4265,geco,3-1414,Dorcas  came  running  out  to  meet  us. 
4266,geco,3-1415,She  was  crying  and  wringing  her  hands. 
4267,geco,3-1416,"I  was  aware  of  other  servants  huddled  together  in  the  background,  all  eyes  and  ears. "
4268,geco,3-1417,"Oh,  m'am! "
4269,geco,3-1418,"Oh,  m'am! "
4270,geco,3-1419,I  don't  know  how  to  tell  you... 
4271,geco,3-1420,"What is  it,  Dorcas?  I  asked  impatiently. "
4272,geco,3-1421,Tell  us  at  once. 
4273,geco,3-1422,It's  those  wicked  detectives. 
4274,geco,3-1423,They've  arrested  him...they've  arrested  Mr.  Cavendish! 
4275,geco,3-1424,Arrested  Lawrence? 
4276,geco,3-1425,I  gasped. 
4277,geco,3-1426,I  saw  a  strange  look  come  into  Dorcas's  eyes. 
4278,geco,3-1427,"No,  sir. "
4279,geco,3-1428,Not  Mr.  Lawrence...Mr.  John. 
4280,geco,3-1429,"Behind  me,  with  a  wild  cry,  Mary  Cavendish  fell  heavily  against  me,  and  as  I  turned  to  catch  her  I  met  the  quiet  triumph  in  Poirot's  eyes. "
4281,geco,4-1,The  trial  of  John  Cavendish  for  the  murder  of  his  stepmother  took  place  two  months  later. 
4282,geco,4-2,"Of  the  intervening  weeks  I  will  say  little,  but  my  admiration  and  sympathy  went  out  unfeignedly  to  Mary  Cavendish. "
4283,geco,4-3,"She  ranged  herself  passionately  on  her  husband's  side,  scorning  the  mere  idea  of  his  guilt,  and  fought  for  him  tooth  and  nail. "
4284,geco,4-4,"I  expressed  my  admiration  to  Poirot,  and  he  nodded  thoughtfully. "
4285,geco,4-5,"Yes,  she  is  of  those  women  who  show  at  their  best  in  adversity. "
4286,geco,4-6,It  brings  out  all  that  is  sweetest  and  truest  in  them. 
4287,geco,4-7,Her  pride  and  her  jealousy  have... 
4288,geco,4-8,Jealousy?  I  queried. 
4289,geco,4-9,Yes. 
4290,geco,4-10,Have  you  not  realized  that  she  is  an  unusually  jealous  woman? 
4291,geco,4-11,"As  I  was  saying,  her  pride  and  jealousy  have  been  laid  aside. "
4292,geco,4-12,"She  thinks  of  nothing  but  her  husband,  and  the  terrible  fate  that  is  hanging  over  him. "
4293,geco,4-13,"He  spoke  very  feelingly,  and  I  looked  at  him  earnestly,  remembering  that  last  afternoon,  when  he  had  been  deliberating  whether  or  not  to  speak. "
4294,geco,4-14,"With  his  tenderness  for  'a  woman's  happiness',  I  felt  glad  that  the  decision  had  been  taken  out  of  his  hands. "
4295,geco,4-15,"Even  now,  I  said,  I  can  hardly  believe  it. "
4296,geco,4-16,"You  see,  up  to  the  very  last  minute,  I  thought  it  was  Lawrence! "
4297,geco,4-17,Poirot  grinned. 
4298,geco,4-18,I  know  you  did. 
4299,geco,4-19,But  John! 
4300,geco,4-20,My  old  friend  John! 
4301,geco,4-21,"Every  murderer  is  probably  somebody's  old  friend,  observed  Poirot  philosophically. "
4302,geco,4-22,You  cannot  mix  up  sentiment  and  reason. 
4303,geco,4-23,I  must  say  I  think  you  might  have  given  me  a  hint. 
4304,geco,4-24,"Perhaps,  mon  ami,  I  did  not  do  so,  just  because  he  was  your  old  friend. "
4305,geco,4-25,"I  was  rather  disconcerted  by  this,  remembering  how  I  had  busily  passed  on  to  John  what  I  believed  to  be  Poirot's  views  concerning  Bauerstein. "
4306,geco,4-26,"He,  by  the  way,  had  been  acquitted  of  the  charge  brought  against  him. "
4307,geco,4-27,"Nevertheless,  although  he  had  been  too  clever  for  them  this  time,  and  the  charge  of  espionage  could  not  be  brought  home  to  him,  his  wings  were  pretty  well  clipped  for  the  future. "
4308,geco,4-28,I  asked  Poirot  whether  he  thought  John  would  be  condemned. 
4309,geco,4-29,"To  my  intense  surprise,  he  replied  that,  on  the  contrary,  he  was  extremely  likely  to  be  acquitted. "
4310,geco,4-30,"But,  Poirot...  I  protested. "
4311,geco,4-31,"Oh,  my  friend,  have  I  not  said  to  you  all  along  that  I  have  no  proofs. "
4312,geco,4-32,"It  is  one  thing  to  know  that  a  man  is  guilty,  it  is  quite  another  matter  to  prove  him  so. "
4313,geco,4-33,"And,  in  this  case,  there  is  terribly  little  evidence. "
4314,geco,4-34,That  is  the  whole  trouble. 
4315,geco,4-35,"I,  Hercule  Poirot,  know,  but  I  lack  the  last  link  in  my  chain. "
4316,geco,4-36,And  unless  I  can  find  that  missing  link...  He  shook  his  head  gravely. 
4317,geco,4-37,"When  did  you  first  suspect  John  Cavendish?  I  asked,  after  a  minute  or  two. "
4318,geco,4-38,Did  you  not  suspect  him  at  all? 
4319,geco,4-39,"No,  indeed. "
4320,geco,4-40,"Not  after  that  fragment  of  conversation  you  overheard  between  Mr.s.  Cavendish  and  her  mother-in-law,  and  her  subsequent  lack  of  frankness  at  the  inquest? "
4321,geco,4-41,No. 
4322,geco,4-42,"Did  you  not  put  two  and  two  together,  and  reflect  that  if  it  was  not  Alfred  Inglethorp  who  was  quarrelling  with  his  wife...and  you  remember,  he  strenuously  denied  it  at  the  inquest...it  must  be  either  Lawrence  or  John. "
4323,geco,4-43,"Now,  if  it  was  Lawrence,  Mary  Cavendish's  conduct  was  just  as  inexplicable. "
4324,geco,4-44,"But  if,  on  the  other  hand,  it  was  John,  the  whole  thing  was  explained  quite  naturally. "
4325,geco,4-45,"So,  I  cried,  a  light  breaking  in  upon  me,  it  was  John  who  quarrelled  with  his  mother  that  afternoon? "
4326,geco,4-46,Exactly. 
4327,geco,4-47,And  you  have  known  this  all  along? 
4328,geco,4-48,Certainly. 
4329,geco,4-49,Mr.s.  Cavendish's  behaviour  could  only  be  explained  that  way. 
4330,geco,4-50,And  yet  you  say  he  may  be  acquitted? 
4331,geco,4-51,Poirot  shrugged  his  shoulders. 
4332,geco,4-52,Certainly  I  do. 
4333,geco,4-53,"At  the  police  court  proceedings,  we  shall  hear  the  case  for  the  prosecution,  but  in  all  probability  his  solicitors  will  advise  him  to  reserve  his  defence. "
4334,geco,4-54,That  will  be  sprung  upon  us  at  the  trial. 
4335,geco,4-55,"And...ah,  by  the  way,  I  have  a  word  of  caution  to  give  you,  my  friend. "
4336,geco,4-56,I  must  not  appear  in  the  case. 
4337,geco,4-57,What? 
4338,geco,4-58,No. 
4339,geco,4-59,"Officially,  I  have  nothing  to  do  with  it. "
4340,geco,4-60,"Until  I  have  found  that  last  link  in  my  chain,  I  must  remain  behind  the  scenes. "
4341,geco,4-61,"Mr.s.  Cavendish  must  think  I  am  working  for  her  husband,  not  against  him. "
4342,geco,4-62,"I  say,  that's  playing  it  a  bit  low  down,  I  protested. "
4343,geco,4-63,Not  at  all. 
4344,geco,4-64,"We  have  to  deal  with  a  most  clever  and  unscrupulous  man,  and  we  must  use  any  means  in  our  power...otherwise  he  will  slip  through  our  fingers. "
4345,geco,4-65,That  is  why  I  have  been  careful  to  remain  in  the  background. 
4346,geco,4-66,"All  the  discoveries  have  been  made  by  Japp,  and  Japp  will  take  all  the  credit. "
4347,geco,4-67,If  I  am  called  upon  to  give  evidence  at  all ...he  smiled  broadly... it  will  probably  be  as  a  witness  for  the  defence. 
4348,geco,4-68,I  could  hardly  believe  my  ears. 
4349,geco,4-69,"It  is  quite  en  regle,  continued  Poirot. "
4350,geco,4-70,"Strangely  enough,  I  can  give  evidence  that  will  demolish  one  contention  of  the  prosecution. "
4351,geco,4-71,Which  one? 
4352,geco,4-72,The  one  that  relates  to  the  destruction  of  the  will. 
4353,geco,4-73,John  Cavendish  did  not  destroy  that  will. 
4354,geco,4-74,Poirot  was  a  true  prophet. 
4355,geco,4-75,"I  will  not  go  into  the  details  of  the  police  court  proceedings,  as  it  involves  many  tiresome  repetitions. "
4356,geco,4-76,"I  will  merely  state  baldly  that  John  Cavendish  reserved  his  defence,  and  was  duly  committed  for  trial. "
4357,geco,4-77,September  found  us  all  in  London. 
4358,geco,4-78,"Mary  took  a  house  in  Kensington,  Poirot  being  included  in  the  family  party. "
4359,geco,4-79,"I  myself  had  been  given  a  job  at  the  War  Office,  so  was  able  to  see  them  continually. "
4360,geco,4-80,"As  the  weeks  went  by,  the  state  of  Poirot's  nerves  grew  worse  and  worse. "
4361,geco,4-81,That  'last  link'  he  talked  about  was  still  lacking. 
4362,geco,4-82,"Privately,  I  hoped  it  might  remain  so,  for  what  happiness  could  there  be  for  Mary,  if  John  were  not  acquitted? "
4363,geco,4-83,"On  September  15th  John  Cavendish  appeared  in  the  dock  at  the  Old  Bailey,  charged  with  The  Wilful  Murder  of  Emily  Agnes  Inglethorp,  and  pleaded  Not  Guilty. "
4364,geco,4-84,"Sir  Ernest  Heavywether,  the  famous  K. "
4365,geco,4-85,"C., "
4366,geco,4-86,had  been  engaged  to  defend  him. 
4367,geco,4-87,"Mr.  Philips,  K. "
4368,geco,4-88,"C., "
4369,geco,4-89,opened  the  case  for  the  Crown. 
4370,geco,4-90,"The  murder,  he  said,  was  a  most  premeditated  and  cold-blooded  one. "
4371,geco,4-91,It  was  neither  more  nor  less  than  the  deliberate  poisoning  of  a  fond  and  trusting  woman  by  the  stepson  to  whom  she  had  been  more  than  a  mother. 
4372,geco,4-92,"Ever  since  his  boyhood,  she  had  supported  him. "
4373,geco,4-93,"He  and  his  wife  had  lived  at  Styles  Court  in  every  luxury,  surrounded  by  her  care  and  attention. "
4374,geco,4-94,She  had  been  their  kind  and  generous  benefactress. 
4375,geco,4-95,"He  proposed  to  call  witnesses  to  show  how  the  prisoner,  a  profligate  and  spendthrift,  had  been  at  the  end  of  his  financial  tether,  and  had  also  been  carrying  on  an  intrigue  with  a  certain  Mr.s.  Raikes,  a  neighbouring  farmer's  wife. "
4376,geco,4-96,"This  having  come  to  his  stepmother's  ears,  she  taxed  him  with  it  on  the  afternoon  before  her  death,  and  a  quarrel  ensued,  part  of  which  was  overheard. "
4377,geco,4-97,"On  the  previous  day,  the  prisoner  had  purchased  strychnine  at  the  village  chemist's  shop,  wearing  a  disguise  by  means  of  which  he  hoped  to  throw  the  onus  of  the  crime  upon  another  man...to  wit,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  husband,  of  whom  he  had  been  bitterly  jealous. "
4378,geco,4-98,"Luckily  for  Mr.  Inglethorp,  he  had  been  able  to  produce  an  unimpeachable  alibi. "
4379,geco,4-99,"On  the  afternoon  of  July  17th,  continued  Counsel,  immediately  after  the  quarrel  with  her  son,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  made  a  new  will. "
4380,geco,4-100,"This  will  was  found  destroyed  in  the  grate  of  her  bedroom  the  following  morning,  but  evidence  had  come  to  light  which  showed  that  it  had  been  drawn  up  in  favour  of  her  husband. "
4381,geco,4-101,"Deceased  had  already  made  a  will  in  his  favour  before  her  marriage,  but...and  Mr.  Philips  wagged  an  expressive  forefinger...the  prisoner  was  not  aware  of  that. "
4382,geco,4-102,"What  had  induced  the  deceased  to  make  a  fresh  will,  with  the  old  one  still  extant,  he  could  not  say. "
4383,geco,4-103,"She  was  an  old  lady,  and  might  possibly  have  forgotten  the  former  one;  or...this  seemed  to  him  more  likely...she  may  have  had  an  idea  that  it  was  revoked  by  her  marriage,  as  there  had  been  some  conversation  on  the  subject. "
4384,geco,4-104,Ladies  were  not  always  very  well  versed  in  legal  knowledge. 
4385,geco,4-105,"She  had,  about  a  year  before,  executed  a  will  in  favour  of  the  prisoner. "
4386,geco,4-106,He  would  call  evidence  to  show  that  it  was  the  prisoner  who  ultimately  handed  his  stepmother  her  coffee  on  the  fatal  night. 
4387,geco,4-107,"Later  in  the  evening,  he  had  sought  admission  to  her  room,  on  which  occasion,  no  doubt,  he  found  an  opportunity  of  destroying  the  will  which,  as  far  as  he  knew,  would  render  the  one  in  his  favour  valid. "
4388,geco,4-108,"The  prisoner  had  been  arrested  in  consequence  of  the  discovery,  in  his  room,  by  Detective  Inspector  Japp...a  most  brilliant  officer...of  the  identical  phial  of  strychnine  which  had  been  sold  at  the  village  chemist's  to  the  supposed  Mr.  Inglethorp  on  the  day  before  the  murder. "
4389,geco,4-109,It  would  be  for  the  jury  to  decide  whether  or  not  these  damning  facts  constituted  an  overwhelming  proof  of  the  prisoner's  guilt. 
4390,geco,4-110,"And,  subtly  implying  that  a  jury  which  did  not  so  decide,  was  quite  unthinkable,  Mr.  Philips  sat  down  and  wiped  his  forehead. "
4391,geco,4-111,"The  first  witnesses  for  the  prosecution  were  mostly  those  who  had  been  called  at  the  inquest,  the  medical  evidence  being  again  taken  first. "
4392,geco,4-112,"Sir  Ernest  Heavywether,  who  was  famous  all  over  England  for  the  unscrupulous  manner  in  which  he  bullied  witnesses,  only  asked  two  questions. "
4393,geco,4-113,"I  take  it,  Dr  Bauerstein,  that  strychnine,  as  a  drug,  acts  quickly? "
4394,geco,4-114,Yes. 
4395,geco,4-115,And  that  you  are  unable  to  account  for  the  delay  in  this  case? 
4396,geco,4-116,Yes. 
4397,geco,4-117,Thank  you. 
4398,geco,4-118,Mr.  Mace  identified  the  phial  handed  him  by  Counsel  as  that  sold  by  him  to  Mr.  Inglethorp. 
4399,geco,4-119,"Pressed,  he  admitted  that  he  only  knew  Mr.  Inglethorp  by  sight. "
4400,geco,4-120,He  had  never  spoken  to  him. 
4401,geco,4-121,The  witness  was  not  cross-examined. 
4402,geco,4-122,"Alfred  Inglethorp  was  called,  and  denied  having  purchased  the  poison. "
4403,geco,4-123,He  also  denied  having  quarrelled  with  his  wife. 
4404,geco,4-124,Various  witnesses  testified  to  the  accuracy  of  these  statements. 
4405,geco,4-125,"The  gardeners'  evidence,  as  to  the  witnessing  of  the  will  was  taken,  and  then  Dorcas  was  called. "
4406,geco,4-126,"Dorcas,  faithful  to  her  young  gentlemen,  denied  strenuously  that  it  could  have  been  John's  voice  she  heard,  and  resolutely  declared,  in  the  teeth  of  everything,  that  it  was  Mr.  Inglethorp  who  had  been  in  the  boudoir  with  her  mistress. "
4407,geco,4-127,A  rather  wistful  smile  passed  across  the  face  of  the  prisoner  in  the  dock. 
4408,geco,4-128,"He  knew  only  too  well  how  useless  her  gallant  defiance  was,  since  it  was  not  the  object  of  the  defence  to  deny  this  point. "
4409,geco,4-129,"Mr.s.  Cavendish,  of  course,  could  not  be  called  upon  to  give  evidence  against  her  husband. "
4410,geco,4-130,"After  various  questions  on  other  matters,  Mr.  Philips  asked:  In  the  month  of  June  last,  do  you  remember  a  parcel  arriving  for  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish  from  Parkson's? "
4411,geco,4-131,Dorcas  shook  her  head. 
4412,geco,4-132,"I  don't  remember,  sir. "
4413,geco,4-133,"It  may  have  done,  but  Mr.  Lawrence  was  away  from  home  part  of  June. "
4414,geco,4-134,"In  the  event  of  a  parcel  arriving  for  him  whilst  he  was  away,  what  would  be  done  with  it? "
4415,geco,4-135,It  would  either  be  put  in  his  room  or  sent  on  after  him. 
4416,geco,4-136,By  you? 
4417,geco,4-137,"No,  sir,  I  should  leave  it  on  the  hall  table. "
4418,geco,4-138,It  would  be  Miss  Howard  who  would  attend  to  anything  like  that. 
4419,geco,4-139,"Evelyn  Howard  was  called  and,  after  being  examined  on  other  points,  was  questioned  as  to  the  parcel. "
4420,geco,4-140,Don't  remember. 
4421,geco,4-141,Lots  of  parcels  come. 
4422,geco,4-142,Can't  remember  one  special  one. 
4423,geco,4-143,"You  do  not  know  if  it  was  sent  after  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish  to  Wales,  or  whether  it  was  put  in  his  room? "
4424,geco,4-144,Don't  think  it  was  sent  after  him. 
4425,geco,4-145,Should  have  remembered  it  if  it  was. 
4426,geco,4-146,"Supposing  a  parcel  arrived  addressed  to  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish,  and  afterwards  it  disappeared,  should  you  remark  its  absence? "
4427,geco,4-147,"No,  don't  think  so. "
4428,geco,4-148,I  should  think  some  one  had  taken  charge  of  it. 
4429,geco,4-149,"I  believe,  Miss  Howard,  that  it  was  you  who  found  this  sheet  of  brown  paper? "
4430,geco,4-150,He  held  up  the  same  dusty  piece  which  Poirot  and  I  had  examined  in  the  morning-room  at  Styles. 
4431,geco,4-151,"Yes,  I  did. "
4432,geco,4-152,How  did  you  come  to  look  for  it? 
4433,geco,4-153,The  Belgian  detective  who  was  employed  on  the  case  asked  me  to  search  for  it. 
4434,geco,4-154,Where  did  you  eventually  discover  it? 
4435,geco,4-155,On  the  top  of...of...a  wardrobe. 
4436,geco,4-156,On  top  of  the  prisoner's  wardrobe? 
4437,geco,4-157,I...I  believe  so. 
4438,geco,4-158,Did  you  not  find  it  yourself? 
4439,geco,4-159,Yes. 
4440,geco,4-160,Then  you  must  know  where  you  found  it? 
4441,geco,4-161,"Yes,  it  was  on  the  prisoner's  wardrobe. "
4442,geco,4-162,That  is  better. 
4443,geco,4-163,"An  assistant  from  Parkson's,  Theatrical  Costumiers,  testified  that  on  June  29th,  they  had  supplied  a  black  beard  to  Mr.  L. "
4444,geco,4-164,"Cavendish,  as  requested. "
4445,geco,4-165,"It  was  ordered  by  letter,  and  a  postal  order  was  enclosed. "
4446,geco,4-166,"No,  they  had  not  kept  the  letter. "
4447,geco,4-167,All  transactions  were  entered  in  their  books. 
4448,geco,4-168,"They  had  sent  the  beard,  as  directed,  to  'L. "
4449,geco,4-169,"Cavendish,  Esq., "
4450,geco,4-170,Styles  Court.' 
4451,geco,4-171,Sir  Ernest  Heavywether  rose  ponderously. 
4452,geco,4-172,Where  was  the  letter  written  from? 
4453,geco,4-173,From  Styles  Court. 
4454,geco,4-174,The  same  address  to  which  you  sent  the  parcel? 
4455,geco,4-175,Yes. 
4456,geco,4-176,And  the  letter  came  from  there? 
4457,geco,4-177,Yes. 
4458,geco,4-178,"Like  a  beast  of  prey,  Heavywether  fell  upon  him:  How  do  you  know? "
4459,geco,4-179,I...I  don't  understand. 
4460,geco,4-180,How  do  you  know  that  letter  came  from  Styles? 
4461,geco,4-181,Did  you  notice  the  postmark? 
4462,geco,4-182,"No...but...  Ah,  you  did  not  notice  the  postmark! "
4463,geco,4-183,And  yet  you  affirm  so  confidently  that  it  came  from  Styles. 
4464,geco,4-184,"It  might,  in  fact,  have  been  any  postmark? "
4465,geco,4-185,Y...es. 
4466,geco,4-186,"In  fact,  the  letter,  though  written  on  stamped  notepaper,  might  have  been  posted  from  anywhere? "
4467,geco,4-187,"From  Wales,  for  instance? "
4468,geco,4-188,"The  witness  admitted  that  such  might  be  the  case,  and  Sir  Ernest  signified  that  he  was  satisfied. "
4469,geco,4-189,"Elizabeth  Wells,  second  housemaid  at  Styles,  stated  that  after  she  had  gone  to  bed  she  remembered  that  she  had  bolted  the  front  door,  instead  of  leaving  it  on  the  latch  as  Mr.  Inglethorp  had  requested. "
4470,geco,4-190,She  had  accordingly  gone  downstairs  again  to  rectify  her  error. 
4471,geco,4-191,"Hearing  a  slight  noise  in  the  West  wing,  she  had  peeped  along  the  passage,  and  had  seen  Mr.  John  Cavendish  knocking  at  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  door. "
4472,geco,4-192,"Sir  Ernest  Heavywether  made  short  work  of  her,  and  under  his  unmerciful  bullying  she  contradicted  herself  hopelessly,  and  Sir  Ernest  sat  down  again  with  a  satisfied  smile  on  his  face. "
4473,geco,4-193,"With  the  evidence  of  Annie,  as  to  the  candle  grease  on  the  floor,  and  as  to  seeing  the  prisoner  take  the  coffee  into  the  boudoir,  the  proceedings  were  adjourned  until  the  following  day. "
4474,geco,4-194,"As  we  went  home,  Mary  Cavendish  spoke  bitterly  against  the  prosecuting  counsel. "
4475,geco,4-195,That  hateful  man! 
4476,geco,4-196,What  a  net  he  has  drawn  around  my  poor  John! 
4477,geco,4-197,How  he  twisted  every  little  fact  until  he  made  it  seem  what  it  wasn't! 
4478,geco,4-198,"Well,  I  said  consolingly,  it  will  be  the  other  way  about  tomorrow. "
4479,geco,4-199,"Yes,  she  said  meditatively;  then  suddenly  dropped  her  voice. "
4480,geco,4-200,"Mr.  Hastings,  you  do  not  think...surely  think...surely  it  could  not  have  been  Lawrence...Oh,  no,  that  could  not  be! "
4481,geco,4-201,"But  I  myself  was  puzzled,  and  as  soon  as  I  was  alone  with  Poirot  I  asked  him  what  he  thought  Sir  Ernest  was  driving  at. "
4482,geco,4-202,Ah!  said  Poirot  appreciatively. 
4483,geco,4-203,"He  is  a  clever  man,  that  Sir  Ernest. "
4484,geco,4-204,Do  you  think  he  believes  Lawrence  guilty? 
4485,geco,4-205,I  do  not  think  he  believes  or  cares  anything! 
4486,geco,4-206,"No,  what  he  is  trying  for  is  to  create  such  confusion  in  the  minds  of  the  jury  that  they  are  divided  in  their  opinion  as  to  which  brother  did  it. "
4487,geco,4-207,He  is  endeavouring  to  make  out  that  there  is  quite  as  much  evidence  against  Lawrence  as  against  John...and  I  am  not  at  all  sure  that  he  will  not  succeed. 
4488,geco,4-208,"Detective-inspector  Detective-inspector  Japp  was  the  first  witness  called  when  the  trial  was  reopened,  and  gave  his  evidence  succinctly  and  briefly. "
4489,geco,4-209,"After  relating  the  earlier  events,  he  proceeded:  Acting  on  information  received,  Superintendent  Summerhaye  and  myself  searched  the  prisoner's  room,  during  his  temporary  absence  from  the  house. "
4490,geco,4-210,"In  his  chest  of  drawers,  hidden  beneath  some  underclothing,  we  found:  first,  a  pair  of  gold-rimmed  pince-nez  similar  to  those  worn  by  Mr.  Inglethorp,  these  were  exhibited,  secondly,  this  phial. "
4491,geco,4-211,"The  phial  was  that  already  recognized  by  the  chemist's  assistant,  a  tiny  bottle  of  blue  glass,  containing  a  few  grains  of  a  white  crystalline  powder,  and  labelled:  Strychnine  Hydrochloride. "
4492,geco,4-212,POISON. 
4493,geco,4-213,"A  fresh  piece  of  evidence  discovered  by  the  detectives  since  the  police  court  proceedings  was  a  long,  almost  new  piece  of  blotting-paper. "
4494,geco,4-214,"It  had  been  found  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  cheque  book,  and  on  being  reversed  at  a  mirror,  showed  clearly  the  words:  . "
4495,geco,4-215,. 
4496,geco,4-216,. 
4497,geco,4-217,erything  of  which  I  die  possessed  I  leave  to  my  beloved  husband  Alfred  Ing... 
4498,geco,4-218,This placed  beyond  question  the  fact  that  the  destroyed  will  had  been  in  favour  of  the  deceased  lady's  husband. 
4499,geco,4-219,"Japp  then  produced  the  charred  fragment  of  paper  recovered  from  the  grate,  and  this,  with  the  discovery  of  the  beard  in  the  attic,  completed  his  evidence. "
4500,geco,4-220,But  Sir  Ernest's  cross-examination  was  yet  to  come. 
4501,geco,4-221,What  day  was  it  when  you  searched  the  prisoner's  room? 
4502,geco,4-222,"Tuesday,  the  24th  of  July. "
4503,geco,4-223,Exactly  a  week  after  the  tragedy? 
4504,geco,4-224,Yes. 
4505,geco,4-225,"You  found  these  two  objects,  you  say,  in  the  chest  of  drawers. "
4506,geco,4-226,Was  the  drawer  unlocked? 
4507,geco,4-227,Yes. 
4508,geco,4-228,Does  it  not  strike  you  as  unlikely  that  a  man  who  had  committed  a  crime  should  keep  the  evidence  of  it  in  an  unlocked  drawer  for  anyone  to  find? 
4509,geco,4-229,He  might  have  stowed  them  there  in  a  hurry. 
4510,geco,4-230,But  you  have  just  said  it  was  a  whole  week  since  the  crime. 
4511,geco,4-231,He  would  have  had  ample  time  to  remove  them  and  destroy  them. 
4512,geco,4-232,Perhaps. 
4513,geco,4-233,There  is  no  perhaps  about  it. 
4514,geco,4-234,"Would  he,  or  would  he  not  have  had  plenty  of  time  to  remove  and  destroy  them? "
4515,geco,4-235,Yes. 
4516,geco,4-236,Was  the  pile  of  underclothes  under  which  the  things  were  hidden  heavy  or  light? 
4517,geco,4-237,Heavyish. 
4518,geco,4-238,"In  other  words,  it  was  winter  underclothing. "
4519,geco,4-239,"Obviously,  the  prisoner  would  not  be  likely  to  go  to  that  drawer? "
4520,geco,4-240,Perhaps  not. 
4521,geco,4-241,Kindly  answer  my  question. 
4522,geco,4-242,"Would  the  prisoner,  in  the  hottest  week  of  a  hot  summer,  be  likely  to  go  to  a  drawer  containing  winter  underclothing. "
4523,geco,4-243,"Yes,  or  no? "
4524,geco,4-244,No. 
4525,geco,4-245,"In  that  case,  is  it  not  possible  that  the  articles  in  question  might  have  been  put  there  by  a  third  person,  and  that  the  prisoner  was  quite  unaware  of  their  presence? "
4526,geco,4-246,I  should  not  think  it  likely. 
4527,geco,4-247,But  it  is  possible? 
4528,geco,4-248,Yes. 
4529,geco,4-249,That  is  all. 
4530,geco,4-250,More  evidence  followed. 
4531,geco,4-251,Evidence  as  to  the  financial  difficulties  in  which  the  prisoner  had  found  himself  at  the  end  of  July. 
4532,geco,4-252,"Evidence  as  to  his  intrigue  with  Mr.s.  Raikes...poor  Mary,  that  must  have  been  bitter  hearing  for  a  woman  of  her  pride. "
4533,geco,4-253,"Evelyn  Howard  had  been  right  in  her  facts,  though  her  animosity  against  Alfred  Inglethorp  had  caused  her  to  jump  to  the  conclusion  that  he  was  the  person  concerned. "
4534,geco,4-254,Lawrence  Cavendish  was  then  put  into  the  box. 
4535,geco,4-255,"In  a  low  voice,  in  answer  to  Mr.  Philips'  questions,  he  denied  having  ordered  anything  from  Parkson's  in  June. "
4536,geco,4-256,"In  fact,  on  June  29th,  he  had  been  staying  away,  in  Wales. "
4537,geco,4-257,"Instantly,  Sir  Ernest's  chin  was  shooting  pugnaciously  forward. "
4538,geco,4-258,You  deny  having  ordered  a  black  beard  from  Parkson's  on  June  29th? 
4539,geco,4-259,I  do. 
4540,geco,4-260,Ah! 
4541,geco,4-261,"In  the  event  of  anything  happening  to  your  brother,  who  will  inherit  Styles  Court? "
4542,geco,4-262,The  brutality  of  the  question  called  a  flush  to  Lawrence's  pale  face. 
4543,geco,4-263,"The  judge  gave  vent  to  a  faint  murmur  of  disapprobation,  and  the  prisoner  in  the  dock  leant  forward  angrily. "
4544,geco,4-264,Heavywether  cared  nothing  for  his  client's  anger. 
4545,geco,4-265,"Answer  my  question,  if  you  please. "
4546,geco,4-266,"I  suppose,  said  Lawrence  quietly,  that  I  should. "
4547,geco,4-267,What  do  you  mean  by  you  'suppose'? 
4548,geco,4-268,Your  brother  has  no  children. 
4549,geco,4-269,"You  would  inherit  it,  wouldn't  you? "
4550,geco,4-270,Yes. 
4551,geco,4-271,"Ah,  that's  better,  said  Heavywether,  with  ferocious  geniality. "
4552,geco,4-272,"And  you'd  inherit  a  good  slice  of  money  too,  wouldn't  you? "
4553,geco,4-273,"Really,  Sir  Ernest,  protested  the  judge,  these  questions  are  not  relevant. "
4554,geco,4-274,"Sir  Ernest  bowed,  and  having  shot  his  arrow  proceeded. "
4555,geco,4-275,"On  Tuesday,  the  17th  July,  you  went,  I  believe,  with  another  guest,  to  visit  the  dispensary  at  the  Red  Cross  Hospital  in  Tadminster? "
4556,geco,4-276,Yes. 
4557,geco,4-277,"Did  you,  while  you  happened  to  be  alone  for  a  few  seconds,  unlock  the  poison  cupboard,  and  examine  some  of  the  bottles? "
4558,geco,4-278,I...I...may  have  done  so. 
4559,geco,4-279,I  put  it  to  you  that  you  did  do  so? 
4560,geco,4-280,Yes. 
4561,geco,4-281,Sir  Ernest  fairly  shot  the  next  question  at  him. 
4562,geco,4-282,Did  you  examine  one  bottle  in  particular? 
4563,geco,4-283,"No,  I  do  not  think  so. "
4564,geco,4-284,"Be  careful,  Mr.  Cavendish. "
4565,geco,4-285,I  am  referring  to  a  little  bottle  of  Hydro-chloride  Hydro-chloride  of  Strychnine. 
4566,geco,4-286,Lawrence  was  turning  a  sickly  greenish  colour. 
4567,geco,4-287,N...o...I  N...o...I  am  sure  I  didn't. 
4568,geco,4-288,Then  how  do  you  account  for  the  fact  that  you  left  the  unmistakable  impress  of  your  finger-prints  on  it? 
4569,geco,4-289,The  bullying  manner  was  highly  efficacious  with  a  nervous  disposition. 
4570,geco,4-290,I...I  suppose  I  must  have  taken  up  the  bottle. 
4571,geco,4-291,I  suppose  so  too! 
4572,geco,4-292,Did  you  abstract  any  of  the  contents  of  the  bottle? 
4573,geco,4-293,Certainly  not. 
4574,geco,4-294,Then  why  did  you  take  it  up? 
4575,geco,4-295,I  once  studied  to  be  a  doctor. 
4576,geco,4-296,Such  things  naturally  interest  me. 
4577,geco,4-297,Ah! 
4578,geco,4-298,"So  poisons  'naturally  interest'  you,  do  they? "
4579,geco,4-299,"Still,  you  waited  to  be  alone  before  gratifying  that  'interest'  of  yours? "
4580,geco,4-300,That  was  pure  chance. 
4581,geco,4-301,"If  the  others  had  been  there,  I  should  have  done  just  the  same. "
4582,geco,4-302,"Still,  as  it  happens,  the  others  were  not  there? "
4583,geco,4-303,"No,  but...... "
4584,geco,4-304,"In fact,  during  the  whole  afternoon,  you  were  only  alone  for  a  couple  of  minutes,  and  it  happened...I  say,  it  happened...to  be  during  those  two  minutes  that  you  displayed  your  'natural  interest'  in  Hydro-chloride  of  Strychnine? "
4585,geco,4-305,Lawrence  stammered  pitiably. 
4586,geco,4-306,I...I...... 
4587,geco,4-307,"With a  satisfied  and  expressive  countenance,  Sir  Ernest  observed:  I  have  nothing  more  to  ask  you,  Mr.  Cavendish. "
4588,geco,4-308,This  bit  of  cross-examination  cross-examination  had  caused  great  excitement  in  court. 
4589,geco,4-309,"The  heads  of  the  many  fashionably  attired  women  present  were  busily  laid  together,  and  their  whispers  became  so  loud  that  the  judge  angrily  threatened  to  have  the  court  cleared  if  there  was  not  immediate  silence. "
4590,geco,4-310,There  was  little  more  evidence. 
4591,geco,4-311,The  hand-writing  experts  were  called  upon  for  their  opinion  of  the  signature  of  'Alfred  Inglethorp'  in  the  chemist's  poison  register. 
4592,geco,4-312,"They  all  declared  unanimously  that  it  was  certainly  not  his  hand-writing,  and  gave  it  as  their  view  that  it  might  be  that  of  the  prisoner  disguised. "
4593,geco,4-313,"Cross-examined,  they  admitted  that  it  might  be  the  prisoner's  hand-writing  cleverly  counterfeited. "
4594,geco,4-314,"Sir  Ernest  Heavywether's  speech  in  opening  the  case  for  the  defence  was  not  a  long  one,  but  it  was  backed  by  the  full  force  of  his  emphatic  manner. "
4595,geco,4-315,"Never,  he  said,  in  the  course  of  his  long  experience,  had  he  known  a  charge  of  murder  rest  on  slighter  evidence. "
4596,geco,4-316,"Not  only  was  it  entirely  circumstantial,  but  the  greater  part  of  it  was  practically  unproved. "
4597,geco,4-317,Let  them  take  the  testimony  they  had  heard  and  sift  it  impartially. 
4598,geco,4-318,The  strychnine  had  been  found  in  a  drawer  in  the  prisoner's  room. 
4599,geco,4-319,"That  drawer  was  an  unlocked  one,  as  he  had  pointed  out,  and  he  submitted  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  prove  that  it  was  the  prisoner  who  had  concealed  the  poison  there. "
4600,geco,4-320,"It  was,  in  fact,  a  wicked  and  malicious  attempt  on  the  part  of  some  third  person  to  fix  the  crime  on  the  prisoner. "
4601,geco,4-321,The  prosecution  had  been  unable  to  produce  a  shred  of  evidence  in  support  of  their  contention  that  it  was  the  prisoner  who  ordered  the  black  beard  from  Parkson's. 
4602,geco,4-322,"The  quarrel  which  had  taken  place  between  prisoner  and  his  stepmother  was  freely  admitted,  but  both  it  and  his  financial  embarrassments  had  been  grossly  exaggerated. "
4603,geco,4-323,"His  learned  friend,  Sir  Ernest  nodded  carelessly  at  Mr.  Philips,  had  stated  that  if  the  prisoner  were  an  innocent  man,  he  would  have  come  forward  at  the  inquest  to  explain  that  it  was  he,  and  not  Mr.  Inglethorp,  who  had  been  the  participator  in  the  quarrel. "
4604,geco,4-324,He  thought  the  facts  had  been  misrepresented. 
4605,geco,4-325,What  had  actually  occurred  was  this. 
4606,geco,4-326,"The  prisoner,  returning  to  the  house  on  Tuesday  evening,  had  been  authoritatively  told  that  there  had  been  a  violent  quarrel  between  Mr.  and  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. "
4607,geco,4-327,No  suspicion  had  entered  the  prisoner's  head  that  anyone  could  possibly  have  mistaken  his  voice  for  that  of  Mr.  Inglethorp. 
4608,geco,4-328,He  naturally  concluded  that  his  stepmother  had  had  two  quarrels. 
4609,geco,4-329,"The  prosecution  averred  that  on  Monday,  July  16th,  the  prisoner  had  entered  the  chemist's  shop  in  the  village,  disguised  as  Mr.  Inglethorp. "
4610,geco,4-330,"The  prisoner,  on  the  contrary,  was  at  that  time  at  a  lonely  spot  called  Marston's  Spinney,  where  he  had  been  summoned  by  an  anonymous  note,  couched  in  blackmailing  terms,  and  threatening  to  reveal  certain  matters  to  his  wife  unless  he  complied  with  its  demands "
4611,geco,4-331,"The prisoner  had,  accordingly,  gone  to  the  appointed  spot,  and  after  waiting  there  vainly  for  half  an  hour  had  returned  home. "
4612,geco,4-332,"Unfortunately,  he  had  met  with  no  one  on  the  way  there  or  back  who  could  vouch  for  the  truth  of  his  story,  but  luckily  he  had  kept  the  note,  and  it  would  be  produced  as  evidence. "
4613,geco,4-333,"As  for  the  statement  relating  to  the  destruction  of  the  will,  the  prisoner  had  formerly  practiced  at  the  Bar,  and  was  perfectly  well  aware  that  the  will  made  in  his  favour  a  year  before  was  automatically  revoked  by  his  stepmother's  remarriage. "
4614,geco,4-334,"He  would  call  evidence  to  show  who  did  destroy  the  will,  and  it  was  possible  that  that  might  open  up  quite  a  new  view  of  the  case. "
4615,geco,4-335,"Finally,  he  would  point  out  to  the  jury  that  there  was  evidence  against  other  people  besides  John  Cavendish. "
4616,geco,4-336,"He  would  direct  their  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  evidence  against  Mr.  Lawrence  Cavendish  was  quite  as  strong,  if  not  stronger  than  that  against  his  brother. "
4617,geco,4-337,He  would  now  call  the  prisoner. 
4618,geco,4-338,John  acquitted  himself  well  in  the  witness-box. 
4619,geco,4-339,"Under  Sir  Ernest's  skilful  handling,  he  told  his  tale  credibly  and  well. "
4620,geco,4-340,"The  anonymous  note  received  by  him  was  produced,  and  handed  to  the  jury  to  examine. "
4621,geco,4-341,"The  readiness  with  which  he  admitted  his  financial  difficulties,  and  the  disagreement  with  his  stepmother,  lent  value  to  his  denials. "
4622,geco,4-342,"At  the  close  of  his  examination,  he  paused,  and  said:  I  should  like  to  make  one  thing  clear. "
4623,geco,4-343,I  utterly  reject  and  disapprove  of  Sir  Ernest  Heavywether's  insinuations  against  my  brother. 
4624,geco,4-344,"My  brother,  I  am  convinced,  had  no  more  to  do  with  the  crime  than  I  have. "
4625,geco,4-345,"Sir  Ernest  merely  smiled,  and  noted  with  a  sharp  eye  that  John's  protest  had  produced  a  very  favourable  impression  on  the  jury. "
4626,geco,4-346,Then  the  cross-examination  began. 
4627,geco,4-347,I  understand  you  to  say  that  it  never  entered  your  head  that  the  witnesses  at  the  inquest  could  possibly  have  mistaken  your  voice  for  that  of  Mr.  Inglethorp. 
4628,geco,4-348,Is  not  that  very  surprising? 
4629,geco,4-349,"No,  I  don't  think  so. "
4630,geco,4-350,"I  was  told  there  had  been  a  quarrel  between  my  mother  and  Mr.  Inglethorp,  and  it  never  occurred  to  me  that  such  was  not  really  the  case. "
4631,geco,4-351,Not  when  the  servant  Dorcas  repeated  certain  fragments  of  the  conversation...fragments  conversation...fragments  which  you  must  have  recognized? 
4632,geco,4-352,I  did  not  recognize  them. 
4633,geco,4-353,Your  memory  must  be  unusually  short! 
4634,geco,4-354,"No,  but  we  were  both  angry,  and,  I  think,  said  more  than  we  meant. "
4635,geco,4-355,I  paid  very  little  attention  to  my  mother's  actual  words. 
4636,geco,4-356,Mr.  Philips'  incredulous  sniff  was  a  triumph  of  forensic  skill. 
4637,geco,4-357,He  passed  on  to  the  subject  of  the  note. You 
4638,geco,4-358,have  produced  this  note  very  opportunely. 
4639,geco,4-359,"Tell  me,  is  there  nothing  familiar  about  the  hand-writing  of  it? "
4640,geco,4-360,Not  that  I  know  of. 
4641,geco,4-361,Do  you  not  think  that  it  bears  a  marked  resemblance  to  your  own  hand-writing...carelessly  hand-writing...carelessly  disguised? 
4642,geco,4-362,"No,  I  do  not  think  so. "
4643,geco,4-363,I  put  it  to  you  that  it  is  your  own  hand-writing! 
4644,geco,4-364,No. 
4645,geco,4-365,"I  put  it  to  you  that,  anxious  to  prove  an  alibi,  you  conceived  the  idea  of  a  fictitious  and  rather  incredible  appointment,  and  wrote  this  note  yourself  in  order  to  bear  out  your  statement! "
4646,geco,4-366,No. 
4647,geco,4-367,"Is  it  not  a  fact  that,  at  the  time  you  claim  to  have  been  waiting  about  at  a  solitary  and  unfrequented  spot,  you  were  really  in  the  chemist's  shop  in  Styles  St. "
4648,geco,4-368,"Mary,  where  you  purchased  strychnine  in  the  name  of  Alfred  Inglethorp? "
4649,geco,4-369,"No,  that  is  a  lie. "
4650,geco,4-370,"I  put  it  to  you  that,  wearing  a  suit  of  Mr.  Inglethorp's  clothes,  with  a  black  beard  trimmed  to  resemble  his,  you  were  there...and  signed  the  register  in  his  name! "
4651,geco,4-371,That  is  absolutely  untrue. 
4652,geco,4-372,"Then  I  will  leave  the  remarkable  similarity  of  hand-writing  between  the  note,  the  register,  and  your  own,  to  the  consideration  of  the  jury,  said  Mr.  Philips,  and  sat  down  with  the  air  of  a  man  who  has  done  his  duty,  but  who  was  nevertheless  horrified  by  such  deliberate  perjury. "
4653,geco,4-373,"After  this,  as  it  was  growing  late,  the  case  was  adjourned  till  Monday. "
4654,geco,4-374,"Poirot,  I  noticed,  was  looking  profoundly  discouraged. "
4655,geco,4-375,He  had  that  little  frown  between  the  eyes  that  I  knew  so  well. 
4656,geco,4-376,"What  is  it,  Poirot? "
4657,geco,4-377,I  inquired. 
4658,geco,4-378,"Ah,  mon  ami,  things  are  going  badly,  badly. "
4659,geco,4-379,"In  spite  of  myself,  my  heart  gave  a  leap  of  relief. "
4660,geco,4-380,Evidently  there  was  a  likelihood  of  John  Cavendish  being  acquitted. 
4661,geco,4-381,"When  we  reached  the  house,  my  little  friend  waved  aside  Mary's  offer  of  tea. "
4662,geco,4-382,"No,  I  thank  you,  madame. "
4663,geco,4-383,I  will  mount  to  my  room. 
4664,geco,4-384,I  followed  him. 
4665,geco,4-385,"Still  frowning,  he  went  across  to  the  desk  and  took  out  a  small  pack  of  patience  cards. "
4666,geco,4-386,"Then  he  drew  up  a  chair  to  the  table,  and,  to  my  utter  amazement,  began  solemnly  to  build  card  houses! "
4667,geco,4-387,"My  jaw  dropped  involuntarily,  and  he  said  at  once:  No,  mon  ami,  I  am  not  in  my  second  childhood! "
4668,geco,4-388,"I  steady  my  nerves,  that  is  all. "
4669,geco,4-389,This  employment  requires  precision  of  the  fingers. 
4670,geco,4-390,With  precision  of  the  fingers  goes  precision  of  the  brain. 
4671,geco,4-391,And  never  have  I  needed  that  more  than  now! 
4672,geco,4-392,What  is  the  trouble?  I  asked. 
4673,geco,4-393,"With  a  great  thump  on  the  table,  Poirot  demolished  his  carefully  built  up  edifice. "
4674,geco,4-394,"It  is  this,  mon  ami! "
4675,geco,4-395,"That  I  can  build  card  houses  seven  stories  high,  but  I  cannot  ÔÇô  thump  ÔÇô  find  ÔÇô  thump  -  that  last  link  of  which  I  spoke  to  you. "
4676,geco,4-396,"I  could  not  quite  tell  what  to  say,  so  I  held  my  peace,  and  he  began  slowly  building  up  the  cards  again,  speaking  in  jerks  as  he  did  so. "
4677,geco,4-397,It  is  done...so! 
4678,geco,4-398,By  placing...one  card...on  another...with  mathematical...precision! 
4679,geco,4-399,"I  watched  the  card  house  rising  under  his  hands,  story  by  story. "
4680,geco,4-400,He  never  hesitated  or  faltered. 
4681,geco,4-401,It  was  really  almost  like  a  conjuring  trick. 
4682,geco,4-402,"What  a  steady  hand  you've  got,  I  remarked. "
4683,geco,4-403,I  believe  I've  only  seen  your  hand  shake  once. 
4684,geco,4-404,"On  an  occasion  when  I  was  enraged,  without  doubt,  observed  Poirot,  with  great  placidity. "
4685,geco,4-405,Yes  indeed! 
4686,geco,4-406,You  were  in  a  towering  rage. 
4687,geco,4-407,Do  you  remember? 
4688,geco,4-408,It  was  when  you  discovered  that  the  lock  of  the  despatch-case  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  bedroom  had  been  forced. 
4689,geco,4-409,"You  stood  by  the  mantel-piece,  twiddling  the  things  on  it  in  your  usual  fashion,  and  your  hand  shook  like  a  leaf! "
4690,geco,4-410,I  must  say......  But  I  stopped  suddenly. 
4691,geco,4-411,"For  Poirot,  uttering  a  hoarse  and  inarticulate  cry,  again  annihilated  his  masterpiece  of  cards,  and  putting  his  hands  over  his  eyes  swayed  backwards  and  forwards,  apparently  suffering  the  keenest  agony. "
4692,geco,4-412,"Good  heavens,  Poirot!  I  cried. "
4693,geco,4-413,What  is  the  matter? 
4694,geco,4-414,Are  you  taken  ill? 
4695,geco,4-415,"No,  no,  he  gasped. "
4696,geco,4-416,It  is...it  is...that  I  have  an  idea! 
4697,geco,4-417,Oh! 
4698,geco,4-418,"I  exclaimed,  much  relieved. "
4699,geco,4-419,One  of  your  'little  ideas'? 
4700,geco,4-420,"Ah,  ma  foi,  no! "
4701,geco,4-421,replied  Poirot  frankly. 
4702,geco,4-422,This  time  it  is  an  idea  gigantic! 
4703,geco,4-423,Stupendous! 
4704,geco,4-424,"And  you...you,  my  friend,  have  given  it  to  me! "
4705,geco,4-425,"Suddenly  clasping  me  in  his  arms,  he  kissed  me  warmly  on  both  cheeks,  and  before  I  had  recovered  from  my  surprise  ran  headlong  from  the  room. "
4706,geco,4-426,Mary  Cavendish  entered  at  that  moment. 
4707,geco,4-427,What  is  the  matter  with  Monsieur  Poirot? 
4708,geco,4-428,He  rushed  past  me  crying  out:  'A  garage! 
4709,geco,4-429,"For  the  love  of  Heaven,  direct  me  to  a  garage,  madame!' "
4710,geco,4-430,"And,  before  I  could  answer,  he  had  dashed  out  into  the  street. I "
4711,geco,4-431,hurried  to  the  window. 
4712,geco,4-432,"True  enough,  there  he  was,  tearing  down  the  street,  hatless,  and  gesticulating  as  he  went. "
4713,geco,4-433,I  turned  to  Mary  with  a  gesture  of  despair. 
4714,geco,4-434,He'll  be  stopped  by  a  policeman  in  another  minute. 
4715,geco,4-435,"There  he  goes,  round  the  corner! "
4716,geco,4-436,"Our  eyes  met,  and  we  stared  helplessly  at  one  another. "
4717,geco,4-437,What  can  be  the  matter? 
4718,geco,4-438,I  shook  my  head. 
4719,geco,4-439,I  don't  know. 
4720,geco,4-440,"He  was  building  card  houses,  when  suddenly  he  said  he  had  an  idea,  and  rushed  off  as  you  saw. "
4721,geco,4-441,"Well,  said  Mary,  I  expect  he  will  be  back  before  dinner. "
4722,geco,4-442,"But  night  fell,  and  Poirot  had  not  returned. "
4723,geco,4-443,Poirot's  abrupt  departure  had  intrigued  us  all  greatly. 
4724,geco,4-444,"Sunday  morning  wore  away,  and  still  he  did  not  reappear. "
4725,geco,4-445,"But  about  three  o'clock  a  ferocious  and  prolonged  hooting  outside  drove  us  to  the  window,  to  see  Poirot  alighting  from  a  car,  accompanied  by  Japp  and  Summerhaye. "
4726,geco,4-446,The  little  man  was  transformed. 
4727,geco,4-447,He  radiated  an  absurd  complacency. 
4728,geco,4-448,He  bowed  with  exaggerated  respect  to  Mary  Cavendish. 
4729,geco,4-449,"Madame,  I  have  your  permission  to  hold  a  little  reunion  in  the  salon? "
4730,geco,4-450,It  is  necessary  for  every  one  to  attend. 
4731,geco,4-451,Mary  smiled  sadly. 
4732,geco,4-452,"You  know,  Monsieur  Poirot,  that  you  have  carte  blanche  in  every  way. "
4733,geco,4-453,"You  are  too  amiable,  madame. "
4734,geco,4-454,"Still  beaming,  Poirot  marshalled  us  all  into  the  drawing-room,  bringing  forward  chairs  as  he  did  so. "
4735,geco,4-455,Miss  Howard...here. 
4736,geco,4-456,Howard...here. 
4737,geco,4-457,Mademoiselle  Cynthia. 
4738,geco,4-458,Monsieur  Lawrence. 
4739,geco,4-459,The  good  Dorcas. 
4740,geco,4-460,And  Annie. 
4741,geco,4-461,Bien! 
4742,geco,4-462,We  must  delay  our  proceedings  a  few  minutes  until  Mr.  Inglethorp  arrives. 
4743,geco,4-463,I  have  sent  him  a  note. 
4744,geco,4-464,Miss  Howard  rose  immediately  from  her  seat. 
4745,geco,4-465,"If  that  man  comes  into  the  house,  I  leave  it! "
4746,geco,4-466,"No,  no! "
4747,geco,4-467,Poirot  went  up  to  her  and  pleaded  in  a  low  voice. 
4748,geco,4-468,Finally  Miss  Howard  consented  to  return  to  her  chair. 
4749,geco,4-469,A  few  minutes  later  Alfred  Inglethorp  entered  the  room. 
4750,geco,4-470,"The  company  once  assembled,  Poirot  rose  from  his  seat  with  the  air  of  a  popular  lecturer,  and  bowed  politely  to  his  audience. "
4751,geco,4-471,"Messieurs,  mesdames,  as  you  all  know,  I  was  called  in  by  Monsieur  John  Cavendish  to  investigate  this  case. "
4752,geco,4-472,"I  at  once  examined  the  bedroom  of  the  deceased  which,  by  the  advice  of  the  doctors,  had  been  kept  locked,  and  was  consequently  exactly  as  it  had  been  when  the  tragedy  occurred. "
4753,geco,4-473,"I  found:  first,  a  fragment  of  green  material;  second,  a  stain  on  the  carpet  near  the  window,  still  damp;  thirdly,  an  empty  box  of  bromide  powders. "
4754,geco,4-474,"To  take  the  fragment  of  green  material  first,  I  found  it  caught  in  the  bolt  of  the  communicating  door  between  that  room  and  the  adjoining  one  occupied  by  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. "
4755,geco,4-475,I  handed  the  fragment  over  to  the  police  who  did  not  consider  it  of  much  importance. 
4756,geco,4-476,Nor  did  they  recognize  it  for  what  it  was...a  piece  torn  from  a  green  land  armlet. 
4757,geco,4-477,There  was  a  little  stir  of  excitement. 
4758,geco,4-478,Now  there  was  only  one  person  at  Styles  who  worked  on  the  land...Mr.s.  Cavendish. 
4759,geco,4-479,Therefore  it  must  have  been  Mr.s.  Cavendish  who  entered  the  deceased's  room  through  the  door  communicating  with  Mademoiselle  Cynthia's  room. 
4760,geco,4-480,But  that  door  was  bolted  on  the  inside!  I  cried. 
4761,geco,4-481,"When  I  examined  the  room,  yes. "
4762,geco,4-482,"But  in  the  first  place  we  have  only  her  word  for  it,  since  it  was  she  who  tried  that  particular  door  and  reported  it  fastened. "
4763,geco,4-483,In  the  ensuing  confusion  she  would  have  had  ample  opportunity  to  shoot  the  bolt  across. 
4764,geco,4-484,I  took  an  early  opportunity  of  verifying  my  conjectures. 
4765,geco,4-485,"To  begin  with,  the  fragment  corresponds  exactly  with  a  tear  in  Mr.s.  Cavendish's  armlet. "
4766,geco,4-486,"Also,  at  the  inquest,  Mr.s.  Cavendish  declared  that  she  had  heard,  from  her  own  room,  the  fall  of  the  table  by  the  bed. "
4767,geco,4-487,"I  took  an  early  opportunity  of  testing  that  statement  by  stationing  my  friend  Monsieur  Hastings  in  the  left  wing  of  the  building,  just  outside  Mr.s.  Cavendish's  door. "
4768,geco,4-488,"I  myself,  in  company  with  the  police,  went  to  the  deceased's  room,  and  whilst  there  I,  apparently  accidentally,  knocked  over  the  table  in  question,  but  found  that,  as  I  had  expected,  Monsieur  Hastings  had  heard  no  sound  at  all. "
4769,geco,4-489,This  confirmed  my  belief  that  Mr.s.  Cavendish  was  not  speaking  the  truth  when  she  declared  that  she  had  been  dressing  in  her  room  at  the  time  of  the  tragedy. 
4770,geco,4-490,"In  fact,  I  was  convinced  that,  far  from  having  been  in  her  own  room,  Mr.s.  Cavendish  was  actually  in  the  deceased's  room  when  the  alarm  was  given. "
4771,geco,4-491,I  shot  a  quick  glance  at  Mary. 
4772,geco,4-492,"She  was  very  pale,  but  smiling. "
4773,geco,4-493,I  proceeded  to  reason  on  that  assumption. 
4774,geco,4-494,Mr.s.  Cavendish  is  in  her  mother-in-law's  mother-in-law's  room. 
4775,geco,4-495,We  will  say  that  she  is  seeking  for  something  and  has  not  yet  found  it. 
4776,geco,4-496,Suddenly  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  awakens  and  is  seized  with  an  alarming  paroxysm. 
4777,geco,4-497,"She  flings  out  her  arm,  overturning  the  bed  table,  and  then  pulls  desperately  at  the  bell. "
4778,geco,4-498,"Mr.s.  Cavendish,  startled,  drops  her  candle,  scattering  the  grease  on  the  carpet. "
4779,geco,4-499,"She  picks  it  up,  and  retreats  quickly  to  Mademoiselle  Cynthia's  room,  closing  the  door  behind  her. "
4780,geco,4-500,"She  hurries  out  into  the  passage,  for  the  servants  must  not  find  her  where  she  is. "
4781,geco,4-501,But  it  is  too  late! 
4782,geco,4-502,Already  footsteps  are  echoing  along  the  gallery  which  connects  the  two  wings. 
4783,geco,4-503,What  can  she  do? 
4784,geco,4-504,"Quick  as  thought,  she  hurries  back  to  the  young  girl's  room,  and  starts  shaking  her  awake. "
4785,geco,4-505,The  hastily  aroused  household  come  trooping  down  the  passage. 
4786,geco,4-506,They  are  all  busily  battering  at  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  door. 
4787,geco,4-507,"It  occurs  to  nobody  that  Mr.s.  Cavendish  has  not  arrived  with  the  rest,  but...and  this  is  significant...I  can  find  no  one  who  saw  her  come  from  the  other  wing. "
4788,geco,4-508,He  looked  at  Mary  Cavendish. 
4789,geco,4-509,"Am  I  right,  madame? "
4790,geco,4-510,She  bowed  her  head. 
4791,geco,4-511,"Quite  right,  monsieur. "
4792,geco,4-512,"You  understand  that,  if  I  had  thought  I  would  do  my  husband  any  good  by  revealing  these  facts,  I  would  have  done  so. "
4793,geco,4-513,But  it  did  not  seem  to  me  to  bear  upon  the  question  of  his  guilt  or  innocence. 
4794,geco,4-514,"In  a  sense,  that  is  correct,  madame. "
4795,geco,4-515,"But  it  cleared  my  mind  of  many  misconceptions,  and  left  me  free  to  see  other  facts  in  their  true  significance. "
4796,geco,4-516,The  will!  cried  Lawrence. 
4797,geco,4-517,"Then  it  was  you,  Mary,  who  destroyed  the  will? "
4798,geco,4-518,"She  shook  her  head,  and  Poirot  shook  his  also. "
4799,geco,4-519,"No,  he  said  quietly. "
4800,geco,4-520,There  is  only  one  person  who  could  possibly  have  destroyed  that  will...Mr.s.  Inglethorp  herself! 
4801,geco,4-521,Impossible! 
4802,geco,4-522,I  exclaimed. 
4803,geco,4-523,She  had  only  made  it  out  that  very  afternoon! 
4804,geco,4-524,"Nevertheless,  mon  ami,  it  was  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. "
4805,geco,4-525,"Because,  in  no  other  way  can  you  account  for  the  fact  that,  on  one  of  the  hottest  days  of  the  year,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  ordered  a  fire  to  be  lighted  in  her  room. "
4806,geco,4-526,I  gave  a  gasp. 
4807,geco,4-527,What  idiots  we  had  been  never  to  think  of  that  fire  as  being  incongruous! 
4808,geco,4-528,"Poirot  was  continuing:  The  temperature  on  that  day,  messieurs,  was  80 degrees  in  the  shade. "
4809,geco,4-529,Yet  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  ordered  a  fire! 
4810,geco,4-530,Why? 
4811,geco,4-531,"Because  she  wished  to  destroy  something,  and  could  think  of  no  other  way. "
4812,geco,4-532,"You  will  remember  that,  in  consequence  of  the  War  economics  practiced  at  Styles,  no  waste  paper  was  thrown  away. "
4813,geco,4-533,There  was  therefore  no  means  of  destroying  a  thick  document  such  as  a  will. 
4814,geco,4-534,"The  moment  I  heard  of  a  fire  being  lighted  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room,  I  leaped  to  the  conclusion  that  it  was  to  destroy  some  important  document...possibly  a  will. "
4815,geco,4-535,So  the  discovery  of  the  charred  fragment  in  the  grate  was  no  surprise  to  me. 
4816,geco,4-536,"I  did  not,  of  course,  know  at  the  time  that  the  will  in  question  had  only  been  made  this  afternoon,  and  I  will  admit  that,  when  I  learnt  that  fact,  I  fell  into  a  grievous  error. "
4817,geco,4-537,"I  came  to  the  conclusion  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  determination  to  destroy  her  will  arose  as  a  direct  consequence  of  the  quarrel  she  had  that  afternoon,  and  that  therefore  the  quarrel  took  place  after,  and  not  before  the  making  of  the  will. "
4818,geco,4-538,"Here,  as  we  know,  I  was  wrong,  and  I  was  forced  to  abandon  that  idea. "
4819,geco,4-539,I  faced  the  problem  from  a  new  standpoint. 
4820,geco,4-540,"Now,  at  4 o'clock,  Dorcas  overheard  her  mistress  saying  angrily:  'You  need  not  think  that  any  fear  of  publicity,  or  scandal  between  husband  and  wife  will  deter  me.' "
4821,geco,4-541,"I  conjectured,  and  conjectured  rightly,  that  these  words  were  addressed,  not  to  her  husband,  but  to  Mr.  John  Cavendish. "
4822,geco,4-542,"At  5 o'clock,  an  hour  later,  she  uses  almost  the  same  words,  but  the  standpoint  is  different. "
4823,geco,4-543,"She  admits  to  Dorcas,  'I  don't  know  what  to  do;  scandal  between  husband  and  wife  is  a  dreadful  thing.' "
4824,geco,4-544,"At  4 o'clock  she  has  been  angry,  but  completely  mistress  of  herself. "
4825,geco,4-545,"At  5 o'clock  she  is  in  violent  distress,  and  speaks  of  having  had  a  great  shock. "
4826,geco,4-546,"Looking  at  the  matter  psychologically,  I  drew  one  deduction  which  I  was  convinced  was  correct. "
4827,geco,4-547,The  second  'scandal'  she  spoke  of  was  not  the  same  as  the  first...and  it  concerned  herself! 
4828,geco,4-548,Let  us  reconstruct. 
4829,geco,4-549,"At  4 o'clock,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  quarrels  with  her  son,  and  threatens  to  denounce  him  to  his  wife...who,  wife...who,  by  the  way,  overheard  the  greater  part  of  the  conversation. "
4830,geco,4-550,"At  4.30, "
4831,geco,4-551,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp,  in  consequence  of  a  conversation  on  the  validity  of  wills,  makes  a  will  in  favour  of  her  husband,  which  the  two  gardeners  witness. "
4832,geco,4-552,"At  5 o'clock,  Dorcas  finds  her  mistress  in  a  state  of  considerable  agitation,  with  a  slip  of  paper...'a  letter,'  Dorcas  thinks...in  her  hand,  and  it  is  then  that  she  orders  the  fire  in  her  room  to  be  lighted. "
4833,geco,4-553,"Presumably,  then,  between  4.30 "
4834,geco,4-554,"and  5 o'clock,  something  has  occurred  to  occasion  a  complete  revolution  of  feeling,  since  she  is  now  as  anxious  to  destroy  the  will,  as  she  was  before  to  make  it. "
4835,geco,4-555,What  was  that  something? 
4836,geco,4-556,"As  far  as  we  know,  she  was  quite  alone  during  that  half-hour. "
4837,geco,4-557,half-hour. 
4838,geco,4-558,Nobody  entered  or  left  that  boudoir. 
4839,geco,4-559,What  then  occasioned  this  sudden  change  of  sentiment? 
4840,geco,4-560,"One  can  only  guess,  but  I  believe  my  guess  to  be  correct. "
4841,geco,4-561,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  no  stamps  in  her  desk. 
4842,geco,4-562,"We  know  this,  because  later  she  asked  Dorcas  to  bring  her  some. "
4843,geco,4-563,Now  in  the  opposite  corner  of  the  room  stood  her  husband's  desk...locked. 
4844,geco,4-564,"She  was  anxious  to  find  some  stamps,  and,  according  to  my  theory,  she  tried  her  own  keys  in  the  desk. "
4845,geco,4-565,That  one  of  them  fitted  I  know. 
4846,geco,4-566,"She  therefore  opened  the  desk,  and  in  searching  for  the  stamps  she  came  across  something  else...that  slip  of  paper  which  Dorcas  saw  in  her  hand,  and  which  assuredly  was  never  meant  for  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  eyes. "
4847,geco,4-567,"On  the  other  hand,  Mr.s.  Cavendish  believed  that  the  slip  of  paper  to  which  her  mother-in-law  clung  so  tenaciously  was  a  written  proof  of  her  own  husband's  infidelity. "
4848,geco,4-568,"She  demanded  it  from  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  who  assured  her,  quite  truly,  that  it  had  nothing  to  do  with  that  matter. "
4849,geco,4-569,Mr.s.  Cavendish  did  not  believe  her. 
4850,geco,4-570,She  thought  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  shielding  her  stepson. 
4851,geco,4-571,"Now  Mr.s.  Cavendish  is  a  very  resolute  woman,  and,  behind  her  mask  of  reserve,  she  was  madly  jealous  of  her  husband. "
4852,geco,4-572,"She  determined  to  get  hold  of  that  paper  at  all  costs,  and  in  this  resolution  chance  came  to  her  aid. "
4853,geco,4-573,"She  happened  to  pick  up  the  key  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  despatch-case,  which  had  been  lost  that  morning. "
4854,geco,4-574,She  knew  that  her  mother-in-law  invariably  kept  all  important  papers  in  this  particular  case. 
4855,geco,4-575,"Mr.s.  Cavendish,  therefore,  made  her  plans  as  only  a  woman  driven  desperate  through  jealousy  could  have  done. "
4856,geco,4-576,Some  time  in  the  evening  she  unbolted  the  door  leading  into  Mademoiselle  Cynthia's  room. 
4857,geco,4-577,"Possibly  she  applied  oil  to  the  hinges,  for  I  found  that  it  opened  quite  noiselessly  when  I  tried  it. "
4858,geco,4-578,"She  put  off  her  project  until  the  early  hours  of  the  morning  as  being  safer,  since  the  servants  were  accustomed  to  hearing  her  move  about  her  room  at  that  time. "
4859,geco,4-579,"She  dressed  completely  in  her  land  kit,  and  made  her  way  quietly  through  Mademoiselle  Cynthia's  room  into  that  of  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. "
4860,geco,4-580,"He  paused  a  moment,  and  Cynthia  interrupted:  But  I  should  have  woken  up  if  anyone  had  come  through  my  room? "
4861,geco,4-581,"Not  if  you  were  drugged,  mademoiselle. "
4862,geco,4-582,Drugged? 
4863,geco,4-583,"Mais,  oui! "
4864,geco,4-584,You  remember ...he  addressed  us  collectively  again... that  again... that  through  all  the  tumult  and  noise  next  door  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  slept. 
4865,geco,4-585,That  admitted  of  two  possibilities. 
4866,geco,4-586,Either  her  sleep  was  feigned...which  I  did  not  believe...or  her  unconsciousness  was  indeed  by  artificial  means. 
4867,geco,4-587,"With  this  latter  idea  in  my  mind,  I  examined  all  the  coffee-cups  most  carefully,  remembering  that  it  was  Mr.s.  Cavendish  who  had  brought  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  her  coffee  the  night  before. "
4868,geco,4-588,"I  took  a  sample  from  each  cup,  and  had  them  analysed...with  no  result. "
4869,geco,4-589,"I  had  counted  the  cups  carefully,  in  the  event  of  one  having  been  removed. "
4870,geco,4-590,"Six  persons  had  taken  coffee,  and  six  cups  were  duly  found. "
4871,geco,4-591,I  had  to  confess  myself  mistaken. 
4872,geco,4-592,Then  I  discovered  that  I  had  been  guilty  of  a  very  grave  oversight. 
4873,geco,4-593,"Coffee  had  been  brought  in  for  seven  persons,  not  six,  for  DrBauerstein  had  been  there  that  evening. "
4874,geco,4-594,"This  changed  the  face  of  the  whole  affair,  for  there  was  now  one  cup  missing. "
4875,geco,4-595,"The  servants  noticed  nothing,  since  Annie,  the  housemaid,  who  took  in  the  coffee,  brought  in  seven  cups,  not  knowing  that  Mr.  Inglethorp  never  drank  it,  whereas  Dorcas,  who  cleared  them  away  the  following  morning,  found  six  as  usual...or  strictly  speaking  she  found  five,  the  sixth  being  the  one  found  broken  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room. "
4876,geco,4-596,I  was  confident  that  the  missing  cup  was  that  of  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. 
4877,geco,4-597,"I  had  an  additional  reason  for  that  belief  in  the  fact  that  all  the  cups  found  contained  sugar,  which  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  never  took  in  her  coffee. "
4878,geco,4-598,My  attention  was  attracted  by  the  story  of  Annie  about  some  'salt'  on  the  tray  of  cocoa  which  she  took  every  night  to  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room. 
4879,geco,4-599,"I  accordingly  secured  a  sample  of  that  cocoa,  and  sent  it  to  be  analysed. "
4880,geco,4-600,"But  that  had  already  been  done  by  Dr  Bauerstein,  said  Lawrence  quickly. "
4881,geco,4-601,Not  exactly. 
4882,geco,4-602,"The  analyst  was  asked  by  him  to  report  whether  strychnine  was,  or  was  not,  present. "
4883,geco,4-603,"He  did  not  have  it  tested,  as  I  did,  for  a  narcotic. "
4884,geco,4-604,For  a  narcotic? 
4885,geco,4-605,Yes. 
4886,geco,4-606,Here  is  the  analyst's  report. 
4887,geco,4-607,"Mr.s.  Cavendish  administered  a  safe,  but  effectual,  narcotic  to  both  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  and  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. "
4888,geco,4-608,And  it  is  possible  that  she  had  a  mauvais  quart  d'heure  in  consequence! 
4889,geco,4-609,"Imagine  her  feelings  when  her  mother-in-law  is  suddenly  taken  ill  and  dies,  and  immediately  after  she  hears  the  word  'Poison'! "
4890,geco,4-610,"She  has  believed  that  the  sleeping  draught  she  administered  was  perfectly  harmless,  but  there  is  no  doubt  that  for  one  terrible  moment  she  must  have  feared  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  death  lay  at  her  door. "
4891,geco,4-611,"She  is  seized  with  panic,  and  under  its  influence  she  hurries  downstairs,  and  quickly  drops  the  coffee-cup  and  saucer  used  by  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  into  a  large  brass  vase,  where  it  is  discovered  later  by  Monsieur  Lawrence. "
4892,geco,4-612,The  remains  of  the  cocoa  she  dare  not  touch. 
4893,geco,4-613,Too  many  eyes  are  upon  her. 
4894,geco,4-614,"Guess  at  her  relief  when  strychnine  is  mentioned,  and  she  discovers  that  after  all  the  tragedy  is  not  her  doing. "
4895,geco,4-615,We  are  now  able  to  account  for  the  symptoms  of  strychnine  poisoning  being  so  long  in  making  their  appearance. 
4896,geco,4-616,A  narcotic  taken  with  strychnine  will  delay  the  action  of  the  poison  for  some  hours. 
4897,geco,4-617,Poirot  paused. 
4898,geco,4-618,"Mary  looked  up  at  him,  the  colour  slowly  rising  in  her  face. "
4899,geco,4-619,"All  you  have  said  is  quite  true,  Monsieur  Poirot. "
4900,geco,4-620,It  was  the  most  awful  hour  of  my  life. 
4901,geco,4-621,I  shall  never  forget  it. 
4902,geco,4-622,But  you  are  wonderful. 
4903,geco,4-623,I  understand  now...... 
4904,geco,4-624,"What I  meant  when  I  told  you  that  you  could  safely  confess  to  Papa  Poirot,  eh? "
4905,geco,4-625,But  you  would  not  trust  me. 
4906,geco,4-626,"I  see  everything  now,  said  Lawrence. "
4907,geco,4-627,"The  drugged  cocoa,  taken  on  top  of  the  poisoned  coffee,  amply  accounts  for  the  delay. "
4908,geco,4-628,Exactly. 
4909,geco,4-629,"But  was  the  coffee  poisoned,  or  was  it  not? "
4910,geco,4-630,"We  come  to  a  little  difficulty  here,  since  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  never  drank  it. "
4911,geco,4-631,What? 
4912,geco,4-632,The  cry  of  surprise  was  universal. 
4913,geco,4-633,No. 
4914,geco,4-634,You  will  remember  my  speaking  of  a  stain  on  the  carpet  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  room? 
4915,geco,4-635,There  were  some  peculiar  points  about  that  stain. 
4916,geco,4-636,"It  was  still  damp,  it  exhaled  a  strong  odour  of  coffee,  and  imbedded  in  the  nap  of  the  carpet  I  found  some  little  splinters  of  china. "
4917,geco,4-637,"What  had  happened  was  plain  to  me,  for  not  two  minutes  before  I  had  placed  my  little  case  on  the  table  near  the  window,  and  the  table,  tilting  up,  had  deposited  it  upon  the  floor  on  precisely  the  identical  spot. "
4918,geco,4-638,"In  exactly  the  same  way,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  laid  down  her  cup  of  coffee  on  reaching  her  room  the  night  before,  and  the  treacherous  table  had  played  her  the  same  trick. "
4919,geco,4-639,"What  happened  next  is  mere  guess  work  on  my  part,  but  I  should  say  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  picked  up  the  broken  cup  and  placed  it  on  the  table  by  the  bed. "
4920,geco,4-640,"Feeling  in  need  of  a  stimulant  of  some  kind,  she  heated  up  her  cocoa,  and  drank  it  off  then  and  there. "
4921,geco,4-641,Now  we  are  faced  with  a  new  problem. 
4922,geco,4-642,We  know  the  cocoa  contained  no  strychnine. 
4923,geco,4-643,The  coffee  was  never  drunk. 
4924,geco,4-644,Yet  the  strychnine  must  have  been  administered  between  seven  and  nine  o'clock  that  evening. 
4925,geco,4-645,What  third  medium  was  there...a  medium  so  suitable  for  disguising  the  taste  of  strychnine  that  it  is  extraordinary  no  one  has  thought  of  it? 
4926,geco,4-646,"Poirot  looked  round  the  room,  and  then  answered  himself  impressively. "
4927,geco,4-647,Her  medicine! 
4928,geco,4-648,Do  you  mean  that  the  murderer  introduced  the  strychnine  into  her  tonic?  I  cried. 
4929,geco,4-649,There  was  no  need  to  introduce  it. 
4930,geco,4-650,It  was  already  there...in  the  mixture. 
4931,geco,4-651,The  strychnine  that  killed  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  was  the  identical  strychnine  prescribed  by  Dr  Wilkins. 
4932,geco,4-652,"To  make  that  clear  to  you,  I  will  read  you  an  extract  from  a  book  on  dispensing  which  I  found  in  the  Dispensary  of  the  Red  Cross  Hospital  at  Tadminster:  'The  following  prescription  has  become  famous  in  text  books:  Strychninae  mixed  with  Bromide. "
4933,geco,4-653,This  solution  deposits  in  a  few  hours  the  greater  part  of  the  strychnine  salt  as  an  insoluble  bromide  in  transparent  crystals. 
4934,geco,4-654,"A  lady  in  England  lost  her  life  by  taking  a  similar  mixture:  the  precipitated  strychnine  collected  at  the  bottom,  and  in  taking  the  last  dose  she  swallowed  nearly  all  of  it!' "
4935,geco,4-655,"Now  there  was,  of  course,  no  bromide  in  Dr  Wilkins'  prescription,  but  you  will  remember  that  I  mentioned  an  empty  box  of  bromide  powders. "
4936,geco,4-656,"One  or  two  of  those  powders  introduced  into  the  full  bottle  of  medicine  would  effectually  precipitate  the  strychnine,  as  the  book  describes,  and  cause  it  to  be  taken  in  the  last  dose. "
4937,geco,4-657,"You  will  learn  later  that  the  person  who  usually  poured  out  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  medicine  was  always  extremely  careful  not  to  shake  the  bottle,  but  to  leave  the  sediment  at  the  bottom  of  it  undisturbed. "
4938,geco,4-658,"Throughout  the  case,  there  have  been  evidences  that  the  tragedy  was  intended  to  take  place  on  Monday  evening. "
4939,geco,4-659,"On  that  day,  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  bell  wire  was  neatly  cut,  and  on  Monday  evening  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  was  spending  the  night  with  friends,  so  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  would  have  been  quite  alone  in  the  right  wing,  completely  shut  off  from  help  of  any  kind,  and  would  have  died,  in  all  probability,  before  medical  aid  could  have  been  summoned. "
4940,geco,4-660,"But  in  her  hurry  to  be  in  time  for  the  village  entertainment  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  forgot  to  take  her  medicine,  and  the  next  day  she  lunched  away  from  home,  so  that  the  last...and  fatal...dose  was  actually  taken  twenty-four  hours  later  than  had  been  anticipated  by  the  murderer;  and  it  is  owing  to  that  delay  that  the  final  proof...the  last  link  of  the  chain...is  now  in  my  hands. "
4941,geco,4-661,"Amid  breathless  excitement,  he  held  out  three  thin  strips  of  paper. "
4942,geco,4-662,"A  letter  in  the  murderer's  own  hand-writing,  mes  amis! "
4943,geco,4-663,"Had  it  been  a  little  clearer  in  its  terms,  it  is  possible  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp,  warned  in  time,  would  have  escaped.. "
4944,geco,4-664,"As  it  was,  she  realized  her  danger,  but  not  the  manner  of  it. "
4945,geco,4-665,"In  the  deathly  silence,  Poirot  pieced  together  the  slips  of  paper  and,  clearing  his  throat,  read:  'Dearest  Evelyn:  'You  will  be  anxious  at  hearing  nothing. "
4946,geco,4-666,It  is  all  right...only  it  will  be  tonight  instead  of  last  night. 
4947,geco,4-667,You  understand. 
4948,geco,4-668,There's  a  good  time  coming  once  the  old  woman  is  dead  and  out  of  the  way. 
4949,geco,4-669,No  one  can  possibly  bring  home  the  crime  to  me. 
4950,geco,4-670,That  idea  of  yours  about  the  bromides  was  a  stroke  of  genius! 
4951,geco,4-671,But  we  must  be  very  circumspect. 
4952,geco,4-672,"A  false  step......'  Here,  my  friends,  the  letter  breaks  off. "
4953,geco,4-673,Doubtless  the  writer  was  interrupted;  but  there  can  be  no  question  as  to  his  identity. 
4954,geco,4-674,We  all  know  this  hand-writing  and...... 
4955,geco,4-675,A howl  that  was  almost  a  scream  broke  the  silence. 
4956,geco,4-676,You  devil! 
4957,geco,4-677,How  did  you  get  it? 
4958,geco,4-678,A  chair  was  overturned. 
4959,geco,4-679,Poirot  skipped  nimbly  aside. 
4960,geco,4-680,"A  quick  movement  on  his  part,  and  his  assailant  fell  with  a  crash. "
4961,geco,4-681,"Messieurs,  mesdames,  said  Poirot,  with  a  flourish,  let  me  introduce  you  to  the  murderer,  Mr.  Alfred  Inglethorp! "
4962,geco,4-682,"Poirot,  you  old  villain,  I  said,  I've  half  a  mind  to  strangle  you! "
4963,geco,4-683,What  do  you  mean  by  deceiving  me  as  you  have  done? 
4964,geco,4-684,We  were  sitting  in  the  library. 
4965,geco,4-685,Several  hectic  days  lay  behind  us. 
4966,geco,4-686,"In  the  room  below,  John  and  Mary  were  together  once  more,  while  Alfred  Inglethorp  and  Miss  Howard  were  in  custody. "
4967,geco,4-687,"Now  at  last,  I  had  Poirot  to  myself,  and  could  relieve  my  still  burning  curiosity. "
4968,geco,4-688,"Poirot  did  not  answer  me  for  a  moment,  but  at  last  he  said:  I  did  not  deceive  you,  mon  ami. "
4969,geco,4-689,"At  most,  I  permitted  you  to  deceive  yourself. "
4970,geco,4-690,"Yes,  but  why? "
4971,geco,4-691,"Well,  it  is  difficult  to  explain. "
4972,geco,4-692,"You  see,  my  friend,  you  have  a  nature  so  honest,  and  a  countenance  so  transparent,  that...enfin,  to  conceal  your  feelings  is  impossible! "
4973,geco,4-693,"If  I  had  told  you  my  ideas,  the  very  first  time  you  saw  Mr.  Alfred  Inglethorp  that  astute  gentleman  would  have...in  your  so  expressive  idiom...'smelt  a  rat'! "
4974,geco,4-694,"And  then,  bon  jour  to  our  chances  of  catching  him! "
4975,geco,4-695,I  think  that  I  have  more  diplomacy  than  you  give  me  credit  for. 
4976,geco,4-696,"My  friend,  besought  Poirot,  I  implore  you,  do  not  enrage  yourself! "
4977,geco,4-697,Your  help  has  been  of  the  most  invaluable. 
4978,geco,4-698,"It  is  but  the  extremely  beautiful  nature  that  you  have,  which  made  me  pause. "
4979,geco,4-699,"Well,  I  grumbled,  a  little  mollified. "
4980,geco,4-700,I  still  think  you  might  have  given  me  a  hint. 
4981,geco,4-701,"But  I  did,  my  friend. "
4982,geco,4-702,Several  hints. 
4983,geco,4-703,You  would  not  take  them. 
4984,geco,4-704,"Think  now,  did  I  ever  say  to  you  that  I  believed  John  Cavendish  guilty? "
4985,geco,4-705,"Did  I  not,  on  the  contrary,  tell  you  that  he  would  almost  certainly  be  acquitted? "
4986,geco,4-706,"Yes,  but...... "
4987,geco,4-707,And did  I  not  immediately  afterwards  speak  of  the  difficulty  of  bringing  the  murderer  to  justice? 
4988,geco,4-708,Was  it  not  plain  to  you  that  I  was  speaking  of  two  entirely  different  persons? 
4989,geco,4-709,"No,  I  said,  it  was  not  plain  to  me! "
4990,geco,4-710,"Then  again,  continued  Poirot,  at  the  beginning,  did  I  not  repeat  to  you  several  times  that  I  didn't  want  Mr.  Inglethorp  arrested  now? "
4991,geco,4-711,That  should  have  conveyed  something  to  you. 
4992,geco,4-712,Do  you  mean  to  say  you  suspected  him  as  long  ago  as  that? 
4993,geco,4-713,Yes. 
4994,geco,4-714,"To  begin  with,  whoever  else  might  benefit  by  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  death,  her  husband  would  benefit  the  most. "
4995,geco,4-715,There  was  no  getting  away  from  that. 
4996,geco,4-716,"When  I  went  up  to  Styles  with  you  that  first  day,  I  had  no  idea  as  to  how  the  crime  had  been  committed,  but  from  what  I  knew  of  Mr.  Inglethorp  I  fancied  that  it  would  be  very  hard  to  find  anything  to  connect  him  with  it. "
4997,geco,4-717,"When  I  arrived  at  the  chateau,  I  realized  at  once  that  it  was  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  who  had  burnt  the  will;  and  there,  by  the  way,  you  cannot  complain,  my  friend,  for  I  tried  my  best  to  force  on  you  the  significance  of  that  bedroom  fire  in  midsummer. "
4998,geco,4-718,"Yes,  yes,  I  said  impatiently. "
4999,geco,4-719,Go  on. 
5000,geco,4-720,"Well,  my  friend,  as  I  say,  my  views  as  to  Mr.  Inglethorp's  guilt  were  very  much  shaken. "
5001,geco,4-721,"There  was,  in  fact,  so  much  evidence  against  him  that  I  was  inclined  to  believe  that  he  had  not  done  it. "
5002,geco,4-722,When  did  you  change  your  mind? 
5003,geco,4-723,"When  I  found  that  the  more  efforts  I  made  to  clear  him,  the  more  efforts  he  made  to  get  himself  arrested. "
5004,geco,4-724,"Then,  when  I  discovered  that  Inglethorp  had  nothing  to  do  with  Mr.s.  Raikes  and  that  in  fact  it  was  John  Cavendish  who  was  interested  in  that  quarter,  I  was  quite  sure. "
5005,geco,4-725,But  why? 
5006,geco,4-726,Simply  this. 
5007,geco,4-727,"If  it  had  been  Inglethorp  who  was  carrying  on  an  intrigue  with  Mr.s.  Raikes,  his  silence  was  perfectly  comprehensible. "
5008,geco,4-728,"But,  when  I  discovered  that  it  was  known  all  over  the  village  that  it  was  John  who  was  attracted  by  the  farmer's  pretty  wife,  his  silence  bore  quite  a  different  interpretation. "
5009,geco,4-729,"It  was  nonsense  to  pretend  that  he  was  afraid  of  the  scandal,  as  no  possible  scandal  could  attach  to  him. "
5010,geco,4-730,"This  attitude  of  his  gave  me  furiously  to  think,  and  I  was  slowly  forced  to  the  conclusion  that  Alfred  Inglethorp  wanted  to  be  arrested. "
5011,geco,4-731,Eh  bien! 
5012,geco,4-732,"from  that  moment,  I  was  equally  determined  that  he  should  not  be  arrested. "
5013,geco,4-733,Wait  a  minute. 
5014,geco,4-734,I  don't  see  why  he  wished  to  be  arrested? 
5015,geco,4-735,"Because,  mon  ami,  it  is  the  law  of  your  country  that  a  man  once  acquitted  can  never  be  tried  again  for  the  same  offence. "
5016,geco,4-736,Aha! 
5017,geco,4-737,but  it  was  clever...his  idea! 
5018,geco,4-738,"Assuredly,  he  is  a  man  of  method. "
5019,geco,4-739,"See  here,  he  knew  that  in  his  position  he  was  bound  to  be  suspected,  so  he  conceived  the  exceedingly  clever  idea  of  preparing  a  lot  of  manufactured  evidence  against  himself. "
5020,geco,4-740,He  wished  to  be  arrested. 
5021,geco,4-741,"He  would  then  produce  his  irreproachable  alibi...and,  hey  presto,  he  was  safe  for  life! "
5022,geco,4-742,"But  I  still  don't  see  how  he  managed  to  prove  his  alibi,  and  yet  go  to  the  chemist's  shop? "
5023,geco,4-743,Poirot  stared  at  me  in  surprise. 
5024,geco,4-744,Is  it  possible? 
5025,geco,4-745,My  poor  friend! 
5026,geco,4-746,You  have  not  yet  realized  that  it  was  Miss  Howard  who  went  to  the  chemist's  shop? 
5027,geco,4-747,Miss  Howard? 
5028,geco,4-748,"But,  certainly. "
5029,geco,4-749,Who  else? 
5030,geco,4-750,It  was  most  easy  for  her. 
5031,geco,4-751,"She  is  of  a  good  height,  her  voice  is  deep  and  manly;  moreover,  remember,  she  and  Inglethorp  are  cousins,  and  there  is  a  distinct  resemblance  between  them,  especially  in  their  gait  and  bearing. "
5032,geco,4-752,It  was  simplicity  itself. 
5033,geco,4-753,They  are  a  clever  pair! 
5034,geco,4-754,"I  am  still  a  little  fogged  as  to  how  exactly  the  bromide  business  was  done,  I  remarked. "
5035,geco,4-755,Bon! 
5036,geco,4-756,I  will  reconstruct  for  you  as  far  as  possible. 
5037,geco,4-757,I  am  inclined  to  think  that  Miss  Howard  was  the  master  mind  in  that  affair. 
5038,geco,4-758,You  remember  her  once  mentioning  that  her  father  was  a  doctor? 
5039,geco,4-759,"Possibly  she  dispensed  his  medicines  for  him,  or  she  may  have  taken  the  idea  from  one  of  the  many  books  lying  about  when  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  was  studying  for  her  exam. "
5040,geco,4-760,"Anyway,  she  was  familiar  with  the  fact  that  the  addition  of  a  bromide  to  a  mixture  containing  strychnine  would  cause  the  precipitation  of  the  latter. "
5041,geco,4-761,Probably  the  idea  came  to  her  quite  suddenly. 
5042,geco,4-762,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  had  a  box  of  bromide  powders,  which  she  occasionally  took  at  night. "
5043,geco,4-763,What  could  be  easier  than  quietly  to  dissolve  one  or  more  of  those  powders  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  large  sized  bottle  of  medicine  when  it  came  from  Coot's? 
5044,geco,4-764,The  risk  is  practically  nil. 
5045,geco,4-765,The  tragedy  will  not  take  place  until  nearly  a  fortnight  later. 
5046,geco,4-766,"If  anyone  has  seen  either  of  them  touching  the  medicine,  they  will  have  forgotten  it  by  that  time. "
5047,geco,4-767,"Miss  Howard  will  have  engineered  her  quarrel,  and  departed  from  the  house. "
5048,geco,4-768,"The  lapse  of  time,  and  her  absence,  will  defeat  all  suspicion. "
5049,geco,4-769,"Yes,  it  was  a  clever  idea! "
5050,geco,4-770,"If  they  had  left  it  alone,  it  is  possible  the  crime  might  never  have  been  brought  home  to  them. "
5051,geco,4-771,But  they  were  not  satisfied. 
5052,geco,4-772,They  tried  to  be  too  clever...and  that  was  their  undoing. 
5053,geco,4-773,"Poirot  puffed  at  his  tiny  cigarette,  his  eyes  fixed  on  the  ceiling. "
5054,geco,4-774,"They  arranged  a  plan  to  throw  suspicion  on  John  Cavendish,  by  buying  strychnine  at  the  village  chemist's,  and  signing  the  register  in  his  hand-writing. "
5055,geco,4-775,On  Monday  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  will  take  the  last  dose  of  her  medicine. 
5056,geco,4-776,"On  Monday,  therefore,  at  six  o'clock,  Alfred  Inglethorp  arranges  to  be  seen  by  a  number  of  people  at  a  spot  far  removed  from  the  village. "
5057,geco,4-777,Miss  Howard  has  previously  made  up  a  cock  and  bull  story  about  him  and  Mr.s.  Raikes  to  account  for  his  holding  his  tongue  afterwards. 
5058,geco,4-778,"At  six  o'clock,  Miss  Howard,  disguised  as  Alfred  Inglethorp,  enters  the  chemist's  shop,  with  her  story  about  a  dog,  obtains  the  strychnine,  and  writes  the  name  of  Alfred  Inglethorp  in  John's  handwriting,  which  she  had  previously  studied  carefully. "
5059,geco,4-779,"But,  as  it  will  never  do  if  John,  too,  can  prove  an  alibi,  she  writes  him  an  anonymous  note...still  copying  his  hand-writing...which  takes  him  to  a  remote  spot  where  it  is  exceedingly  unlikely  that  anyone  will  see  him. "
5060,geco,4-780,"So  far,  all  goes  well. "
5061,geco,4-781,Miss  Howard  goes  back  to  Middlingham. 
5062,geco,4-782,Alfred  Inglethorp  returns  to  Styles. 
5063,geco,4-783,"There  is  nothing  that  can  compromise  him  in  any  way,  since  it  is  Miss  Howard  who  has  the  strychnine,  which,  after  all,  is  only  wanted  as  a  blind  to  throw  suspicion  on  John  Cavendish.But "
5064,geco,4-784,now  a  hitch  occurs. 
5065,geco,4-785,Mr.s.  Inglethorp  does  not  take  her  medicine  that  night. 
5066,geco,4-786,"The  broken  bell,  Cynthia's  absence...arranged  by  Inglethorp  through  his  wife...all  these  are  wasted. "
5067,geco,4-787,And  then...he  makes  his  slip. 
5068,geco,4-788,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  is  out,  and  he  sits  down  to  write  to  his  accomplice,  who,  he  fears,  may  be  in  a  panic  at  the  nonsuccess  of  their  plan. "
5069,geco,4-789,It  is  probable  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  returned  earlier  than  he  expected. 
5070,geco,4-790,"Caught  in  the  act,  and  somewhat  flurried  he  hastily  shuts  and  locks  his  desk. "
5071,geco,4-791,"He  fears  that  if  he  remains  in  the  room  he  may  have  to  open  it  again,  and  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  might  catch  sight  of  the  letter  before  he  could  snatch  it  up. "
5072,geco,4-792,"So  he  goes  out  and  walks  in  the  woods,  little  dreaming  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  will  open  his  desk,  and  discover  the  incriminating  document. "
5073,geco,4-793,"But  this,  as  we  know,  is  what  happened. "
5074,geco,4-794,"Mr.s.  Inglethorp  reads  it,  and  becomes  aware  of  the  perfidy  of  her  husband  and  Evelyn  Howard,  though,  unfortunately,  the  sentence  about  the  bromides  conveys  no  warning  to  her  mind. "
5075,geco,4-795,She  knows  that  she  is  in  danger...but  is  ignorant  of  where  the  danger  lies. 
5076,geco,4-796,"She  decides  to  say  nothing  to  her  husband,  but  sits  down  and  writes  to  her  solicitor,  asking  him  to  come  on  the  morrow,  and  she  also  determines  to  destroy  immediately  the  will  which  she  has  just  made. "
5077,geco,4-797,She  keeps  the  fatal  letter. 
5078,geco,4-798,"It  was  to  discover  that  letter,  then,  that  her  husband  forced  the  lock  of  the  despatch-case? "
5079,geco,4-799,"Yes,  and  from  the  enormous  risk  he  ran  we  can  see  how  fully  he  realized  its  importance. "
5080,geco,4-800,"That  letter  excepted,  there  was  absolutely  nothing  to  connect  him  with  the  crime. "
5081,geco,4-801,"There's  only  one  thing  I  can't  make  out,  why  didn't  he  destroy  it  at  once  when  he  got  hold  of  it? "
5082,geco,4-802,Because  he  did  not  dare  take  the  biggest  risk  of  all...that  of  keeping  it  on  his  own  person. 
5083,geco,4-803,I  don't  understand. 
5084,geco,4-804,Look  at  it  from  his  point  of  view. 
5085,geco,4-805,"I  have  discovered  that  there  were  only  five  short  minutes  in  which  he  could  have  taken  it...the  five  minutes  immediately  before  our  own  arrival  on  the  scene,  for  before  that  time  Annie  was  brushing  the  stairs,  and  would  have  seen  anyone  who  passed  going  to  the  right  wing. "
5086,geco,4-806,Figure  to  yourself  the  scene! 
5087,geco,4-807,"He  enters  the  room,  unlocking  the  door  by  means  of  one  of  the  other  doorkeys...they  were  all  much  alike. "
5088,geco,4-808,"He  hurries  to  the  despatch-case...it  is  locked,  and  the  keys  are  nowhere  to  be  seen. "
5089,geco,4-809,"That  is  a  terrible  blow  to  him,  for  it  means  that  his  presence  in  the  room  cannot  be  concealed  as  he  had  hoped. "
5090,geco,4-810,But  he  sees  clearly  that  everything  must  be  risked  for  the  sake  of  that  damning  piece  of  evidence. 
5091,geco,4-811,"Quickly,  he  forces  the  lock  with  a  penknife,  and  turns  over  the  papers  until  he  finds  what  he  is  looking  for. "
5092,geco,4-812,But  now  a  fresh  dilemma  arises:  he  dare  not  keep  that  piece  of  paper  on  him. 
5093,geco,4-813,He  may  be  seen  leaving  the  room...he  may  be  searched. 
5094,geco,4-814,"If  the  paper  is  found  on  him,  it  is  certain  doom. "
5095,geco,4-815,"Probably,  at  this  minute,  too,  he  hears  the  sounds  below  of  Mr.  Wells  and  John  leaving  the  boudoir. "
5096,geco,4-816,He  must  act  quickly. 
5097,geco,4-817,Where  can  he  hide  this  terrible  slip  of  paper? 
5098,geco,4-818,"The  contents  of  the  waste-paper-basket  waste-paper-basket  are  kept  and  in  any  case,  are  sure  to  be  examined. "
5099,geco,4-819,There  are  no  means  of  destroying  it;  and  he  dare  not  keep  it. 
5100,geco,4-820,"He  looks  round,  and  he  sees...what  do  you  think,  mon  ami? "
5101,geco,4-821,I  shook  my  head. 
5102,geco,4-822,"In  a  moment,  he  has  torn  the  letter  into  long  thin  strips,  and  rolling  them  up  into  spills  he  thrusts  them  hurriedly  in  amongst  the  other  spills  in  the  vase  on  the  mantle-piece. "
5103,geco,4-823,I  uttered  an  exclamation. 
5104,geco,4-824,"No  one  would  think  of  looking  there,  Poirot  continued. "
5105,geco,4-825,"And  he  will  be  able,  at  his  leisure,  to  come  back  and  destroy  this  solitary  piece  of  evidence  against  him. "
5106,geco,4-826,"Then,  all  the  time,  it  was  in  the  spill  vase  in  Mr.s.  Inglethorp's  bedroom,  under  our  very  noses?  I  cried. "
5107,geco,4-827,Poirot  nodded. 
5108,geco,4-828,"Yes,  my  friend. "
5109,geco,4-829,"That  is  where  I  discovered  my  'last  link,'  and  I  owe  that  very  fortunate  discovery  to  you. "
5110,geco,4-830,To  me? 
5111,geco,4-831,Yes. 
5112,geco,4-832,Do  you  remember  telling  me  that  my  hand  shook  as  I  was  straightening  the  ornaments  on  the  mantel-piece? 
5113,geco,4-833,"Yes,  but  I  don't  see...... "
5114,geco,4-834,No but  I  saw. 
5115,geco,4-835,"Do  you  know,  my  friend,  I  remembered  that  earlier  in  the  morning,  when  we  had  been  there  together,  I  had  straightened  all  the  objects  on  the  mantel-piece. "
5116,geco,4-836,mantel-piece. 
5117,geco,4-837,"And,  if  they  were  already  straightened,  there  would  be  no  need  to  straighten  them  again,  unless,  in  the  meantime,  some  one  else  had  touched  them. "
5118,geco,4-838,"Dear  me,  I  murmured,  so  that  is  the  explanation  of  your  extraordinary  behaviour. "
5119,geco,4-839,"You  rushed  down  to  Styles,  and  found  it  still  there? "
5120,geco,4-840,"Yes,  and  it  was  a  race  for  time. "
5121,geco,4-841,But  I  still  can't  understand  why  Inglethorp  was  such  a  fool  as  to  leave  it  there  when  he  had  plenty  of  opportunity  to  destroy  it. 
5122,geco,4-842,"Ah,  but  he  had  no  opportunity. "
5123,geco,4-843,I  saw  to  that. 
5124,geco,4-844,You? 
5125,geco,4-845,Yes. 
5126,geco,4-846,Do  you  remember  reproving  me  for  taking  the  household  into  my  confidence  on  the  subject? 
5127,geco,4-847,Yes. 
5128,geco,4-848,"Well,  my  friend,  I  saw  there  was  just  one  chance. "
5129,geco,4-849,"I  was  not  sure  then  if  Inglethorp  was  the  criminal  or  not,  but  if  he  was  I  reasoned  that  he  would  not  have  the  paper  on  him,  but  would  have  hidden  it  somewhere,  and  by  enlisting  the  sympathy  of  the  household  I  could  effectually  prevent  his  destroying  it. "
5130,geco,4-850,"He  was  already  under  suspicion,  and  by  making  the  matter  public  I  secured  the  services  of  about  ten  amateur  detectives,  who  would  be  watching  him  unceasingly,  and  being  himself  aware  of  their  watchfulness  he  would  not  dare  seek  further  to  destroy  the  document. "
5131,geco,4-851,"He  was  therefore  forced  to  depart  from  the  house,  leaving  it  in  the  spill  vase. "
5132,geco,4-852,But  surely  Miss  Howard  had  ample  opportunities  of  aiding  him. 
5133,geco,4-853,"Yes,  but  Miss  Howard  did  not  know  of  the  paper's  existence. "
5134,geco,4-854,"In  accordance  with  their  prearranged  plan,  she  never  spoke  to  Alfred  Inglethorp. "
5135,geco,4-855,"They  were  supposed  to  be  deadly  enemies,  and  until  John  Cavendish  was  safely  convicted  they  neither  of  them  dared  risk  a  meeting. "
5136,geco,4-856,"Of  course  I  had  a  watch  kept  on  Mr.  Inglethorp,  hoping  that  sooner  or  later  he  would  lead  me  to  the  hiding-place. "
5137,geco,4-857,But  he  was  too  clever  to  take  any  chances. 
5138,geco,4-858,"The  paper  was  safe  where  it  was;  since  no  one  had  thought  of  looking  there  in  the  first  week,  it  was  not  likely  they  would  do  so  afterwards. "
5139,geco,4-859,"But  for  your  lucky  remark,  we  might  never  have  been  able  to  bring  him  to  justice. "
5140,geco,4-860,I  understand  that  now;  but  when  did  you  first  begin  to  suspect  Miss  Howard? 
5141,geco,4-861,When  I  discovered  that  she  had  told  a  lie  at  the  inquest  about  the  letter  she  had  received  from  Mr.s.  Inglethorp. 
5142,geco,4-862,"Why,  what  was  there  to  lie  about? "
5143,geco,4-863,You  saw  that  letter? 
5144,geco,4-864,Do  you  recall  its  general  appearance? 
5145,geco,4-865,Yes...more  or  less. 
5146,geco,4-866,"You  will  recollect,  then,  that  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  wrote  a  very  distinctive  hand,  and  left  large  clear  spaces  between  her  words. "
5147,geco,4-867,But  if  you  look  at  the  date  at  the  top  of  the  letter  you  will  notice  that  'July  17th'  is  quite  different  in  this  respect. 
5148,geco,4-868,Do  you  see  what  I  mean? 
5149,geco,4-869,"No,  I  confessed,  I  don't. "
5150,geco,4-870,"You  do  not  see  that  that  letter  was  not  written  on  the  17th,  but  on  the  7th...the  7th...the  day  after  Miss  Howard's  departure? "
5151,geco,4-871,The  '1'  was  written  in  before  the  '7'  to  turn  it  into  the  '17th'. 
5152,geco,4-872,But  why? 
5153,geco,4-873,That  is  exactly  what  I  asked  myself. 
5154,geco,4-874,"Why  does  Miss  Howard  suppress  the  letter  written  on  the  17th,  and  produce  this  faked  one  instead? "
5155,geco,4-875,Because  she  did  not  wish  to  show  the  letter  of  the  17th. 
5156,geco,4-876,"Why,  again? "
5157,geco,4-877,And  at  once  a  suspicion  dawned  in  my  mind. 
5158,geco,4-878,You  will  remember  my  saying  that  it  was  wise  to  beware  of  people  who  were  not  telling  you  the  truth. 
5159,geco,4-879,"And  yet,  I  cried  indignantly,  after  that,  you  gave  me  two  reasons  why  Miss  Howard  could  not  have  committed  the  crime! "
5160,geco,4-880,"And  very  good  reasons  too,  replied  Poirot. "
5161,geco,4-881,For  a  long  time  they  were  a  stumbling-block  to  me  until  I  remembered  a  very  significant  fact:  that  she  and  Alfred  Inglethorp  were  cousins. 
5162,geco,4-882,"She  could  not  have  committed  the  crime  single-handed,  but  the  reasons  against  that  did  not  debar  her  from  being  an  accomplice. "
5163,geco,4-883,"And,  then,  there  was  that  rather  over-vehement  over-vehement  hatred  of  hers! "
5164,geco,4-884,It  concealed  a  very  opposite  emotion. 
5165,geco,4-885,"There  was,  undoubtedly,  a  tie  of  passion  between  them  long  before  he  came  to  Styles. "
5166,geco,4-886,"They  had  already  arranged  their  infamous  plot...that  he  should  marry  this  rich,  but  rather  foolish  old  lady,  induce  her  to  make  a  will  leaving  her  money  to  him,  and  then  gain  their  ends  by  a  very  cleverly  conceived  crime. "
5167,geco,4-887,"If  all  had  gone  as  they  planned,  they  would  probably  have  left  England,  and  lived  together  on  their  poor  victim's  money. "
5168,geco,4-888,They  are  a  very  astute  and  unscrupulous  pair. 
5169,geco,4-889,"While  suspicion  was  to  be  directed  against  him,  she  would  be  making  quiet  preparations  for  a  very  different  denouement. "
5170,geco,4-890,She  arrives  from  Middlingham  with  all  the  compromising  items  in  her  possession. 
5171,geco,4-891,No  suspicion  attaches  to  her. 
5172,geco,4-892,No  notice  is  paid  to  her  coming  and  going  in  the  house. 
5173,geco,4-893,She  hides  the  strychnine  and  glasses  in  John's  room. 
5174,geco,4-894,She  puts  the  beard  in  the  attic. 
5175,geco,4-895,She  will  see  to  it  that  sooner  or  later  they  are  duly  discovered. 
5176,geco,4-896,"I  don't  quite  see  why  they  tried  to  fix  the  blame  on  John,  I  remarked. "
5177,geco,4-897,It  would  have  been  much  easier  for  them  to  bring  the  crime  home  to  Lawrence. 
5178,geco,4-898,"Yes,  but  that  was  mere  chance. "
5179,geco,4-899,All  the  evidence  against  him  arose  out  of  pure  accident. 
5180,geco,4-900,"It  must,  in  fact,  have  been  distinctly  annoying  to  the  pair  of  schemers. "
5181,geco,4-901,"His  manner  was  unfortunate,  I  observed  thoughtfully. "
5182,geco,4-902,Yes. 
5183,geco,4-903,"You  realize,  of  course,  what  was  at  the  back  of  that? "
5184,geco,4-904,No. 
5185,geco,4-905,You  did  not  understand  that  he  believed  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  guilty  of  the  crime? 
5186,geco,4-906,"No,  I  exclaimed,  astonished. "
5187,geco,4-907,Impossible! 
5188,geco,4-908,Not  at  all. 
5189,geco,4-909,I  myself  nearly  had  the  same  idea. 
5190,geco,4-910,It  was  in  my  mind  when  I  asked  Mr.  Wells  that  first  question  about  the  will. 
5191,geco,4-911,"Then  there  were  the  bromide  powders  which  she  had  made  up,  and  her  clever  male  impersonations,  as  Dorcas  recounted  them  to  us. "
5192,geco,4-912,There  was  really  more  evidence  against  her  than  anyone  else. 
5193,geco,4-913,"You  are  joking,  Poirot! "
5194,geco,4-914,No. 
5195,geco,4-915,Shall  I  tell  you  what  made  Monsieur  Lawrence  turn  so  pale  when  he  first  entered  his  mother's  room  on  the  fatal  night? 
5196,geco,4-916,"It  was  because,  whilst  his  mother  lay  there,  obviously  poisoned,  he  saw,  over  your  shoulder,  that  the  door  into  Mademoiselle  Cynthia's  room  was  unbolted. "
5197,geco,4-917,But  he  declared  that  he  saw  it  bolted!  I  cried. 
5198,geco,4-918,"Exactly,  said  Poirot  dryly. "
5199,geco,4-919,And  that  was  just  what  confirmed  my  suspicion  that  it  was  not. 
5200,geco,4-920,He  was  shielding  Mademoiselle  Cynthia. 
5201,geco,4-921,But  why  should  he  shield  her? 
5202,geco,4-922,Because  he  is  in  love  with  her. 
5203,geco,4-923,I  laughed. 
5204,geco,4-924,"There,  Poirot,  you  are  quite  wrong! "
5205,geco,4-925,"I  happen  to  know  for  a  fact  that,  far  from  being  in  love  with  her,  he  positively  dislikes  her. "
5206,geco,4-926,"Who  told  you  that,  mon  ami? "
5207,geco,4-927,Cynthia  herself. 
5208,geco,4-928,La  pauvre  petite! 
5209,geco,4-929,And  she  was  concerned? 
5210,geco,4-930,She  said  that  she  did  not  mind  at  all. 
5211,geco,4-931,"Then  she  certainly  did  mind  very  much,  remarked  Poirot. "
5212,geco,4-932,They  are  like  that...les  femmes! 
5213,geco,4-933,"What  you  say  about  Lawrence  is  a  great  surprise  to  me,  I  said. "
5214,geco,4-934,But  why?ÔÇ? 
5215,geco,4-935,ÔÇ£It  was  most  obvious. 
5216,geco,4-936,Did  not  Monsieur  Lawrence  make  the  sour  face  every  time  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  spoke  and  laughed  with  his  brother? 
5217,geco,4-937,He  had  taken  it  into  his  long  head  that  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  was  in  love  with  Monsieur  John. 
5218,geco,4-938,"When  he  entered  his  mother's  room,  and  saw  her  obviously  poisoned,  he  jumped  to  the  conclusion  that  Mademoiselle  Cynthia  knew  something  about  the  matter. "
5219,geco,4-939,He  was  nearly  driven  desperate. 
5220,geco,4-940,"First  he  crushed  the  coffee-cup  to  powder  under  his  feet,  remembering  that  she  had  gone  up  with  his  mother  the  night  before,  and  he  determined  that  there  should  be  no  chance  of  testing  its  contents. "
5221,geco,4-941,"Thenceforward,  he  strenuously,  and  quite  uselessly,  upheld  the  theory  of  'Death  from  natural  causes'. And "
5222,geco,4-942,what  about  the  'extra  coffee-cup'? 
5223,geco,4-943,"I  was  fairly  certain  that  it  was  Mr.s.  Cavendish  who  had  hidden  it,  but  I  had  to  make  sure. "
5224,geco,4-944,"Monsieur  Lawrence  did  not  know  at  all  what  I  meant;  but,  on  reflection,  he  came  to  the  conclusion  that  if  he  could  find  an  extra  coffee-cup  anywhere  his  lady  love  would  be  cleared  of  suspicion. "
5225,geco,4-945,And  he  was  perfectly  right. 
5226,geco,4-946,One  thing  more. 
5227,geco,4-947,What  did  Mr.s.  Inglethorp  mean  by  her  dying  words? 
5228,geco,4-948,"They  were,  of  course,  an  accusation  against  her  husband. "
5229,geco,4-949,"Dear  me,  Poirot,  I  said  with  a  sigh,  I  think  you  have  explained  everything. "
5230,geco,4-950,I  am  glad  it  has  all  ended  so  happily. 
5231,geco,4-951,Even  John  and  his  wife  are  reconciled. 
5232,geco,4-952,Thanks  to  me. 
5233,geco,4-953,How  do  you  mean...thanks  to  you? 
5234,geco,4-954,"My  dear  friend,  do  you  not  realize  that  it  was  simply  and  solely  the  trial  which  has  brought  them  together  again? "
5235,geco,4-955,"That  John  Cavendish  still  loved  his  wife,  I  was  convinced. "
5236,geco,4-956,"Also,  that  she  was  equally  in  love  with  him. "
5237,geco,4-957,But  they  had  drifted  very  far  apart. 
5238,geco,4-958,It  all  arose  from  a  misunderstanding. 
5239,geco,4-959,She  married  him  without  love. 
5240,geco,4-960,He  knew  it. 
5241,geco,4-961,"He  is  a  sensitive  man  in  his  way,  he  would  not  force  himself  upon  her  if  she  did  not  want  him. "
5242,geco,4-962,"And,  as  he  withdrew,  her  love  awoke. "
5243,geco,4-963,"But  they  are  both  unusually  proud,  and  their  pride  held  them  inexorably  apart. "
5244,geco,4-964,"He  drifted  into  an  entanglement  with  Mr.s.  Raikes,  and  she  deliberately  cultivated  the  friendship  of  Dr  Bauerstein. "
5245,geco,4-965,"Do  you  remember  the  day  of  John  Cavendish's  arrest,  when  you  found  me  deliberating  over  a  big  decision? "
5246,geco,4-966,"Yes,  I  quite  understood  your  distress. "
5247,geco,4-967,"Pardon  me,  mon  ami,  but  you  did  not  understand  it  in  the  least. "
5248,geco,4-968,I  was  trying  to  decide  whether  or  not  I  would  clear  John  Cavendish  at  once. 
5249,geco,4-969,I  could  have  cleared  him...though  it  might  have  meant  a  failure  to  convict  the  real  criminals. 
5250,geco,4-970,They  were  entirely  in  the  dark  as  to  my  real  attitude  up  to  the  very  last  moment...which  moment...which  partly  accounts  for  my  success. 
5251,geco,4-971,Do  you  mean  that  you  could  have  saved  John  Cavendish  from  being  brought  to  trial? 
5252,geco,4-972,"Yes,  my  friend. "
5253,geco,4-973,But  I  eventually  decided  in  favour  of  'a  woman's  happiness'. 
5254,geco,4-974,Nothing  but  the  great  danger  through  which  they  have  passed  could  have  brought  these  two  proud  souls  together  again. 
5255,geco,4-975,I  looked  at  Poirot  in  silent  amazement. 
5256,geco,4-976,The  colossal  cheek  of  the  little  man! 
5257,geco,4-977,Who  on  earth  but  Poirot  would  have  thought  of  a  trial  for  murder  as  a  restorer  of  conjugal  happiness! 
5258,geco,4-978,"I  perceive  your  thoughts,  mon  ami,  said  Poirot,  smiling  at  me. "
5259,geco,4-979,No  one  but  Hercule  Poirot  would  have  attempted  such  a  thing! 
5260,geco,4-980,And  you  are  wrong  in  condemning  it. 
5261,geco,4-981,The  happiness  of  one  man  and  one  woman  is  the  greatest  thing  in  all  the  world. 
5262,geco,4-982,His  words  took  me  back  to  earlier  events. 
5263,geco,4-983,"I  remembered  Mary  as  she  lay  white  and  exhausted  on  the  sofa,  listening,  listening. "
5264,geco,4-984,There  had  come  the  sound  of  the  bell  below. 
5265,geco,4-985,She  had  started  up. 
5266,geco,4-986,"Poirot  had  opened  the  door,  and  meeting  her  agonized  eyes  had  nodded  gently. "
5267,geco,4-987,"Yes,  madame,  he  said. "
5268,geco,4-988,I  have  brought  him  back  to  you. 
5269,geco,4-989,"He  had  stood  aside,  and  as  I  went  out  I  had  seen  the  look  in  Mary's  eyes,  as  John  Cavendish  had  caught  his  wife  in  his  arms. "
5270,geco,4-990,"Perhaps  you  are  right,  Poirot,  I  said  gently. "
5271,geco,4-991,"Yes,  it  is  the  greatest  thing  in  the  world. "
5272,geco,4-992,"Suddenly,  there  was  a  tap  at  the  door,  and  Cynthia  peeped  in. "
5273,geco,4-993,I...I  only...... 
5274,geco,4-994,"Come in,  I  said,  springing  up. "
5275,geco,4-995,"She  came  in,  but  did  not  sit  down. "
5276,geco,4-996,I...only  wanted  to  tell  you  something...... 
5277,geco,4-997,Yes?
5278,geco,4-998,"Cynthia  fidgeted  with  a  little  tassel  for  some  moments,  then,  suddenly  exclaiming:  You  dears! "
5279,geco,4-999,"kissed  first  me  and  then  Poirot,  and  rushed  out  of  the  room  again. "
5280,geco,4-1000,"What  on  earth  does  this  mean?  I  asked,  surprised. "
5281,geco,4-1001,"It  was  very  nice  to  be  kissed  by  Cynthia,  but  the  publicity  of  the  salute  rather  impaired  the  pleasure. "
5282,geco,4-1002,"It  means  that  she  has  discovered  Monsieur  Lawrence  does  not  dislike  her  as  much  as  she  thought,  replied  Poirot  philosophically. "
5283,geco,4-1003,But......  Here  he  is. 
5284,geco,4-1004,Lawrence  at  that  moment  passed  the  door. 
5285,geco,4-1005,Eh! 
5286,geco,4-1006,"Monsieur  Lawrence,  called  Poirot. "
5287,geco,4-1007,"We  must  congratulate  you,  is  it  not  so? "
5288,geco,4-1008,"Lawrence  blushed,  and  then  smiled  awkwardly. "
5289,geco,4-1009,A  man  in  love  is  a  sorry  spectacle. 
5290,geco,4-1010,Now  Cynthia  had  looked  charming. 
5291,geco,4-1011,I  sighed. 
5292,geco,4-1012,"What  is  it,  mon  ami? "
5293,geco,4-1013,"Nothing,  I  said  sadly. "
5294,geco,4-1014,They  are  two  delightful  women! 
5295,geco,4-1015,And  neither  of  them  is  for  you? 
5296,geco,4-1016,finished  Poirot. 
5297,geco,4-1017,Never  mind. 
5298,geco,4-1018,"Console  yourself,  my  friend. "
5299,geco,4-1019,"We  may  hunt  together  again,  who  knows? "
5300,natstories,1,"If you were to journey to the North of England, you would come to a valley that is surrounded by moors as high as mountains."
5301,natstories,2,"It is in this valley where you would find the city of Bradford, where once a thousand spinning-jennies that hummed and clattered spun wool into money for the long-bearded mill owners."
5302,natstories,3,"That all mill owners were generally busy as beavers and quite pleased with themselves for being so successful and well off was known to the residents of Bradford, and if you were to go into the city to visit the stately City Hall, you would see there the Crest of the City of Bradford, which those same mill-owners created to celebrate their achievements."
5303,natstories,4,"It shows a sinister looking boar's head sitting on top of a well which seems puzzling at first, but the reason for this symbol is a matter of legend."
5304,natstories,5,"There was once, legend has it, a fearsome boar, which lived in a wood located just outside the manor of Bradford."
5305,natstories,6,"A source of great trouble to the local folk the boar was, bringing terror to the peaceful flocks and ravaging the countryside around."
5306,natstories,7,"Even worse, however, the boar most liked to go to the well that was in the wood and drink its fresh water, so that the people of Bradford had second thoughts about visiting the well."
5307,natstories,8,That the people of Bradford bore the brunt of the beast’s ferocity was unfair in the eyes of the people of the region.
5308,natstories,9,"Eventually, the issue reached the ears of the kindly Lord of the Manor who the people had often asked for help."
5309,natstories,10,The Lord saw the severity of the problem the people faced and suggested a contest could solve the problem.
5310,natstories,11,"He said that whoever could kill the boar and bring as proof its head to the Manor House, would be rewarded with land and fame."
5311,natstories,12,It was the people of Bradford and the people who knew them who rejoiced at this proclamation but one question remained: who would kill the boar?
5312,natstories,13,"By the handsome reward many felt tempted, but the thought of the boar with its deadly tusks and face like thunder soon put an end to their ambitions."
5313,natstories,14,"However, there was one huntsman, who was still wet behind the ears, who decided the prize was worth a shot in spite of the boar's reputation."
5314,natstories,15,The huntsman discovered the boar preferred to come out in the middle of the day.
5315,natstories,16,"So, he went to the wood by the well with his good bow, to bide his time."
5316,natstories,17,"Around noontime, the boar, feared by the locals, came out, as slow as a snail, from among the trees, just as the huntsman had predicted."
5317,natstories,18,The huntsman leaped from his hiding place and through the heart with his fine arrows shot the boar.
5318,natstories,19,Now the problem was no longer to kill the boar.
5319,natstories,20,It was to find a way to carry the boar back.
5320,natstories,21,"The head was too heavy for the little huntsman to carry back to the Manor House, but the huntsman, who was as quick-witted and cunning as ever, asked himself, “What else can I do to prove I killed the boar?”"
5321,natstories,22,"The next instance he opened the boar's mouth and cut out its tongue, taking that as proof for the Lord."
5322,natstories,23,"He set out for the Manor House as quickly as he could and he had only been gone a few minutes when a second huntsman, not so bold as the first but a little more cunning, came on the scene."
5323,natstories,24,"Seeing the slain carcass of the boar, the huntsman rejoiced in his good fortune."
5324,natstories,25,"The second huntsman knew a shortcut to the Manor House was just around the nearby pond, and, being a bigger man than the first, was able to pick up the boar's head and carry it through the wood towards the prize that awaited him."
5325,natstories,26,The Lord of the Manor was seated in his hall when the second huntsman burst through the door and began to spin a line.
5326,natstories,27,The woes of Bradford are ended! he announced.
5327,natstories,28,With my own hand I have slain the boar!
5328,natstories,29,"And, with that, at the feet of his lord he dropped the boar's enormous head."
5329,natstories,30,"Then you will be rewarded, as I promised."
5330,natstories,31,"But first, let me examine the head of this monster, said the Lord of the Manor."
5331,natstories,32,To not examine the head in advance had not been very clever on the part of the huntsman.
5332,natstories,33,"Right away, the Lord noticed the tongue of the boar was missing and exclaimed, ""What is this?"
5333,natstories,34,"A boar with no tongue?"""
5334,natstories,35,"He looked at the huntsman, dubiously."
5335,natstories,36,How come this creature has no tongue? he demanded.
5336,natstories,37,All eyes were on the huntsman.
5337,natstories,38,"The huntsman questioned by the Lord replied, ""I cannot say, my Lord."""
5338,natstories,39,He was suddenly realizing his tricky situation could end badly for him.
5339,natstories,40,"Through the door at this moment, the first huntsman burst."
5340,natstories,41,The woes of Bradford are ended! he cried.
5341,natstories,42,I have slain the boar the people of Bradford dreaded!
5342,natstories,43,All eyes turned to the man who now stood in the doorway.
5343,natstories,44,"The reward is already given, said the Lord of the Manor."
5344,natstories,45,The man here has brought to me the boar's head.
5345,natstories,46,Then where is its tongue? the first huntsman replied.
5346,natstories,47,"And, so saying, he drew out the boar's tongue he had put in his hunting pouch and related how he had ambushed the creature in the wood and cut out its tongue as proof of his victory."
5347,natstories,48,"Listening to the tale, the Lord of the Manor tried to discern which huntsman was telling him the truth and what the two huntsmen were thinking as they waited for him to make a decision."
5348,natstories,49,"Almost instantly, the Lord saw that the second huntsman had fed him a pack of lies and it was the first huntsman who was the true savior of Bradford."
5349,natstories,50,The Lord believed the second huntsman had tried to steal the first huntsman’s prize and so proclaimed the first huntsman the true victor.
5350,natstories,51,The Lord wondered for a moment why he always encountered so much chicanery in his everyday interactions.
5351,natstories,52,"The huntsman who had earned his prize fair and square received as his reward a piece of land just outside the town, known thereafter as Hunt Yard."
5352,natstories,53,"His fame was indeed assured, but it was not nearly as lasting as that of the fearsome Bradford Boar."
